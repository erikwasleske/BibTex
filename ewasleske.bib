	abstract = {The massive black holes found at the centre of most galaxies, including our own, release prodigious amounts of energy that power spectacular phenomena such as quasars and active galactic nuclei. If just a tiny fraction of that energy were absorbed into the host galaxy it could stop star formation in its tracks by heating and ejecting the ambient gas. The latest of our 'IYA 2009' reviews, marking the International Year of Astronomy and collected together on http://www.nature.com/astro09, tackles one of the central questions in galaxy evolution ---the degree to which black hole activity has limited star formation in large elliptical galaxies. These contain much less cool gas and fewer young stars than spiral galaxies, a contrast that could relate to how the central black hole interacts with its surroundings.},

@article{butler2011,
	abstract = {We present a novel method for the optimal selection of quasars using time-series observations in a single photometric bandpass. Utilizing the damped random walk model of Kelly et al., we parameterize the ensemble quasar structure function in Sloan Stripe 82 as a function of observed brightness. The ensemble model fit can then be evaluated rigorously for and calibrated with individual light curves with no parameter fitting. This yields a classification in two statistics---one describing the fit confidence and the other describing the probability of a false alarm---which can be tuned, a priori, to achieve high quasar detection fractions (99% completeness with default cuts), given an acceptable rate of false alarms. We establish the typical rate of false alarms due to known variable stars as ≲3% (high purity). Applying the classification, we increase the sample of potential quasars relative to those known in Stripe 82 by as much as 29%, and by nearly a factor of two in the redshift range 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3, where selection by color is extremely inefficient. This represents 1875 new quasars in a 290 deg2 field. The observed rates of both quasars and stars agree well with the model predictions, with &gt;99% of quasars exhibiting the expected variability profile. We discuss the utility of the method at high redshift and in the regime of noisy and sparse data. Our time-series selection complements well-independent selection based on quasar colors and has strong potential for identifying high-redshift quasars for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and other cosmology studies in the LSST era.},

@article{hinkle2024,
	abstract = {{Some galaxies show little to no sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, yet exhibit strong coronal emission lines (CLs) relative to common narrow emission lines. Many of these CLs have ionization potentials of ≥100 eV, thus requiring strong extreme UV and/or soft X-ray flux. It has long been thought that such events are powered by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but owing to a lack of detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, such a connection has not been firmly made. Here we compare coronal line emitters (CLEs) and TDEs in terms of their host-galaxy and transient properties. We find that the mid-infrared (MIR) colors of CLE hosts in quiescence are similar to TDE hosts. Additionally, many CLEs show evidence of a large dust reprocessing echo in their mid-infrared colors, a sign of significant dust in the nucleus. The stellar masses and star formation rates of the CLE hosts are largely consistent with TDE hosts, with many CLEs residing within the green valley. The blackbody properties of CLEs and TDEs are similar, with some CLEs showing hot (T ≥40, 000 K) blackbody temperatures. Finally, the location of CLEs on the peak-luminosity/decline-rate parameter space is much closer to TDEs than many other major classes of nuclear transients. Combined, these provide strong evidence to confirm the previous claims that CLEs are indeed TDEs in gas-rich environments. We additionally propose a stricter threshold of CL flux ≥1/3 × [O iii] flux to better exclude AGNs from the sample of CLEs.}},

@article{groves2006,
	abstract = {{Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [N ii] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [S ii] and [O i] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [N ii] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2--3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ∼23 000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ∼40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.}},

@article{gallo2010,
	abstract = {We complete the census of nuclear X-ray activity in 100 early-type Virgo galaxies observed by the Chandra X-ray Telescope as part of the AMUSE-Virgo survey, down to a (3σ) limiting luminosity of 3.7 × 1038 erg s−1 over 0.5--7 keV. The stellar mass distribution of the targeted sample, which is mostly composed of formally ``inactive'' galaxies, peaks below 1010 M☉, a regime where the very existence of nuclear supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is debated. Out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear X-ray source, including 6 hybrid nuclei which also host a massive nuclear cluster as visible from archival Hubble Space Telescope images. After carefully accounting for contamination from nuclear low-mass X-ray binaries based on the shape and normalization of their X-ray luminosity function (XLF), we conclude that between 24% and 34% of the galaxies in our sample host an X-ray active SMBH (at the 95% confidence level). This sets a firm lower limit to the black hole (BH) occupation fraction in nearby bulges within a cluster environment. The differential logarithmic XLF of active SMBHs scales with the X-ray luminosity as LX−0.4$\pm$0.1 up to 1042 erg s−1. At face value, the active fraction---down to our luminosity limit---is found to increase with host stellar mass. However, taking into account selection effects, we find that the average Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity scales with BH mass as MBH, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.46+0.08−0.06 dex. This finding can be interpreted as observational evidence for ``down-sizing'' of BH accretion in local early types, that is, low-mass BHs shine relatively closer to their Eddington limit than higher mass objects. As a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, defined as those above a fixed X-ray Eddington ratio, decreases with increasing BH mass.},

	abstract = {{We present an analysis of Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)/Hubble Space Telescope optical spectra of a sample of 10 Seyfert galaxies aimed at studying the structure and physical properties of the coronal-line region (CLR). The high spatial resolution provided by STIS allowed us to resolve the CLR and obtain key information about the kinematics of the CL gas, measure directly its spatial scale, and study the mechanisms that drive the high-ionization lines. We find CLRs extending from just a few parsecs ( pc) up to 230 pc in radius, consistent with the bulk of the coronal lines (CLs) originating between the broad-line region and narrow-line region (NLR), and extending into the NLR in the case of [Fe vii] and [Ne v] lines. The CL profiles strongly vary with the distance to the nucleus. We observed line splitting in the core of some of the galaxies. Line peak shifts, both redshift and blueshift, typically reached 500 km s−1, and even higher velocities (1000 km s−1) in some of the galaxies. In general, CLs follow the same pattern of rotation curves as low-ionization lines like [O iii]. From a direct comparison between the radio and the CL emission we find that neither the strength nor the kinematics of the CLs scales in any obvious and strong way with the radio jets. Moreover, the similarity of the flux distributions and kinematics of the CLs and low-ionization lines, the low temperatures derived for the gas, and the success of photoionization models to reproduce, within a factor of a few, the observed line ratios, point towards photoionization as the main driving mechanism of CLs.}},

	abstract = {We conduct the first systematic survey of a comprehensive set of the twenty optical coronal lines in the spectra of nearly 1 million galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 catalog. This includes often overlooked high ionization potential lines such as [Ar x] λ5533, [S xii] λ7609, [Fe xi] λ7892, and [Fe xiv] λ5303. We find that, given the limited sensitivity of SDSS, strong coronal line emission is extremely rare, with only ∼0.03% of the sample showing at least one coronal line, significantly lower than the fraction of galaxies showing optical narrow line ratios (∼17%) or mid-infrared colors (∼2%) indicative of nuclear activity. The coronal line luminosities exhibit a large dynamic range, with values ranging from ∼1034 to 1042 erg s−1. We find that a vast majority (∼80%) of coronal line emitters in dwarf galaxies (M * &lt; 9.6 × 109  M ⊙) do not display optical narrow line ratios indicative of nuclear activity, in contrast to higher mass galaxies (∼17%). Moreover, we find that the highest ionization potential lines are preferentially found in lower mass galaxies. These findings are consistent with the theory that lower mass black holes found in lower mass galaxies produce a hotter accretion disk, which in turn enhances the higher ionization coronal line spectrum. Future coronal line searches with 30 m class telescopes or JWST may provide a pathway into uncovering the intermediate mass black hole population.},

	abstract = {We report the detection of coherent pulsations from the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 7793 P13. The ≈0.42 s nearly sinusoidal pulsations were initially discovered in broadband X-ray observations using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR taken in 2016. We subsequently also found pulsations in archival XMM-Newton data taken in 2013 and 2014. The significant (≫5σ) detection of coherent pulsations demonstrates that the compact object in P13 is a neutron star, and given the observed peak luminosity of ≈1040  (assuming isotropy), it is well above the Eddington limit for a 1.4  accretor. This makes P13 the second ULX known to be powered by an accreting neutron star. The pulse period varies between epochs, with a slow but persistent spin-up over the 2013--2016 period. This spin-up indicates a magnetic field of B ≈1.5 ×1012 G, typical of many Galactic accreting pulsars. The most likely explanation for the extreme luminosity is a high degree of beaming; however, this is difficult to reconcile with the sinusoidal pulse profile.},

This new source underwent an outburst in 2012, when it was detected by XMM--Newton and the Swift X-ray telescope. The outburst reached a peak luminosity of 3.4 × 1039 erg s−1 and lasted for about eight months, after which the source went below a luminosity of 1037 erg s−1; previous Chandra observations constrain the low-state luminosity below ∼2 × 1036 erg s−1, implying a variability of at least a factor 1000. We propose four possible optical counterparts, found in archival HST observations of the galaxy.

	abstract = {The ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) source ESO 243--49 HLX-1, which reaches a maximum luminosity of 1042 erg s−1 (0.2--10 keV), currently provides the strongest evidence for the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To study the spectral variability of the source, we conduct an ongoing monitoring campaign with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT), which now spans more than two years. We found that HLX-1 showed two fast rise and exponential decay type outbursts in the Swift XRT light curve with increases in the count rate of a factor ∼40 separated by 375 $\pm$ 13 days. We obtained new XMM-Newton and Chandra dedicated pointings that were triggered at the lowest and highest luminosities, respectively. From spectral fitting, the unabsorbed luminosities ranged from 1.9 × 1040 to 1.25 × 1042 erg s−1. We confirm here the detection of spectral state transitions from HLX-1 reminiscent of Galactic black hole binaries (GBHBs): at high luminosities, the X-ray spectrum showed a thermal state dominated by a disk component with temperatures of 0.26 keV at most, and at low luminosities the spectrum is dominated by a hard power law with a photon index in the range 1.4--2.1, consistent with a hard state. The source was also observed in a state consistent with the steep power-law state, with a photon index of ∼3.5. In the thermal state, the luminosity of the disk component appears to scale with the fourth power of the inner disk temperature, which supports the presence of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. The low fractional variability (rms of 9% $\pm$ 9%) in this state also suggests the presence of a dominant disk. The spectral changes and long-term variability of the source cannot be explained by variations of the beaming angle and are not consistent with the source being in a super-Eddington accretion state as is proposed for most ULX sources with lower luminosities. All this indicates that HLX-1 is an unusual ULX as it is similar to GBHBs, which have non-beamed and sub-Eddington emission, but with luminosities three orders of magnitude higher. In this picture, a lower limit on the mass of the black hole of &gt;9000 M☉ can be derived, and the relatively low disk temperature in the thermal state also suggests the presence of an IMBH of a few 103 M☉.},

	abstract = {We present new radio, optical, and X-ray observations of three ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that are associated with large-scale nebulae. We report the discovery of a radio nebula associated with the ULX IC 342 X-1 using the Very Large Array (VLA). Complementary VLA observations of the nebula around Holmberg II X-1, and high-frequency Australia Telescope Compact Array and Very Large Telescope spectroscopic observations of NGC 5408 X-1 are also presented. We study the morphology, ionization processes, and the energetics of the optical/radio nebulae of IC 342 X-1, Holmberg II X-1, and NGC 5408 X-1. The energetics of the optical nebula of IC 342 X-1 is discussed in the framework of standard bubble theory. The total energy content of the optical nebula is 6 × 1052 erg. The minimum energy needed to supply the associated radio nebula is 9.2 × 1050 erg. In addition, we detected an unresolved radio source at the location of IC 342 X-1 at the VLA scales. However, our Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations using the European VLBI Network likely rule out the presence of any compact radio source at milliarcsecond (mas) scales. Using a simultaneous Swift X-ray Telescope measurement, we estimate an upper limit on the mass of the black hole in IC 342 X-1 using the ``fundamental plane'' of accreting black holes and obtain MBH ⩽ (1.0 $\pm$ 0.3) × 103 M☉. Arguing that the nebula of IC 342 X-1 is possibly inflated by a jet, we estimate accretion rates and efficiencies for the jet of IC 342 X-1 and compare with sources like S26, SS433, and IC 10 X-1.},

	abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are promising test beds for constraining models of supermassive and intermediate-mass black holes (MBHs) via their BH occupation fraction (BHOF). Disentangling seeding from the confounding effects of mass assembly over a Hubble time is a challenging problem that we tackle in this study with a suite of semianalytical models (SAMs). We show how the measured BHOF depends on the lowest BH mass or active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity achieved by a survey. To tell seeding models apart, we need to detect or model all AGNs brighter than 1037 erg s−1 in galaxies of M * ∼ 108−10  M ⊙. Shallower surveys, like eRASS, cannot distinguish between seed models even with the compensation of a much larger survey volume. We show that the AMUSE survey, with its inference of the MBH population underlying the observed AGNs, strongly favors heavy seed models, growing with either a power-law Eddington ratio distribution function or one in which BH accretion is tied to the star formation rate (i.e., the AGN-main sequence, AGN-MS, model). These two growth channels can then be distinguished by the AGN luminosity function at &gt;1040 erg s−1, with the AGN-MS model requiring more accretion than observed at z ∼ 0. Thus, current X-ray observations favor heavy seeds whose Eddington ratios follow a power-law distribution. The different models also predict different radio scaling relations, which we quantify using the fundamental plane of BH activity. We close with recommendations for the design of upcoming multiwavelength campaigns that can optimally detect MBHs in dwarf galaxies.},

Here, we present high spatial resolution observations of three dwarf galaxies in the X-ray (Chandra), the optical/near-infrared (Hubble Space Telescope), and the radio (Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array). These three galaxies were previously identified as hosting candidate active galactic nuclei on the basis of lower resolution X-ray imaging. With our new observations, we find that X-ray sources in two galaxies (SDSS J121326.01+543631.6 and SDSS J122111.29+173819.1) are off-nuclear and lack corresponding radio emission, implying they are likely luminous X-ray binaries. The third galaxy (Mrk 1434) contains two X-ray sources (each with LX ≈ 1040 erg s−1) separated by 2.8 arcsec, has a low metallicity [12 + log(O/H)  = 7.8], and emits nebular He ii λ4686 line emission. The northern source has spatially coincident point-like radio emission at 9.0 GHz and extended radio emission at 5.5 GHz. We discuss X-ray binary interpretations (where an ultraluminous X-ray source blows a `radio bubble') and active galactic nucleus interpretations (where an \\$\\approx 4\\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot\\$ black hole launches a jet). In either case, we find that the He ii emission cannot be photoionized by the X-ray source, unless the source was ≈30--90 times more luminous several hundred years ago.}},

	abstract = {{We study the emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM) in a sample of nearby late-type galaxies defined in Paper I. Our sample covers a broad range of star formation rates (SFRs) from ∼0.1 to ∼17 M⊙ yr−1 and stellar masses from ∼3 × 108 to ∼6 × 1010 M⊙. We take special care of systematic effects and contamination from bright and faint compact sources. We find that in all galaxies at least one optically thin thermal emission component is present in the unresolved emission, with the average temperature of 〈kT〉 = 0.24 keV. In about ∼1/3 of galaxies, a second, higher temperature component is required, with 〈kT〉 = 0.71 keV. Although statistically significant variations in temperature between galaxies are present, we do not find any meaningful trends with the stellar mass or SFR of the host galaxy. The apparent luminosity of the diffuse emission in the 0.5--2 keV band linearly correlates with the SFR with the scale factor of Lx/SFR≈8.3×1038ergs−1(M⊙yr−1)−1, of which in average ∼30--40 per cent is likely produced by faint compact sources of various types. We attempt to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the gas and obtain results differing by an order of magnitude, log(Lbol/SFR) ∼ 39−40, depending on whether intrinsic absorption in star-forming galaxies is allowed or not. Our theoretically most accurate, but in practice the most model-dependent result for the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the ISM is Lbol/SFR ∼ 1.5×1040erg s−1(M⊙yr−1)−1. Assuming that core-collapse supernovae are the main source of energy, it is implied that ϵSN ∼ 5×10−2(ESN/1051)−1 of mechanical energy of supernovae is converted into thermal energy of the ISM.}},

@article{charlot2001,
	abstract = {{We present a new model for computing consistently the line and continuum emission from galaxies, based on a combination of recent population synthesis and photoionization codes. We use effective parameters to describe the H ii regions and the diffuse gas ionized by single stellar generations in a galaxy, among which the most important ones are the zero-age effective ionization parameter, the effective gas metallicity and the effective dust-to-heavy element ratio. We calibrate the nebular properties of our model using the observed [O iii]/Hβ, [O ii]/[O iii], [S ii]/Hα and [N ii]/[S ii] ratios of a representative sample of nearby spiral and irregular, starburst and H ii galaxies. To compute whole (line plus continuum) spectral energy distributions, we include the absorption by dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) using a recent simple prescription, which is consistent with observations of nearby starburst galaxies. Our model enables us to interpret quantitatively the observed optical spectra of galaxies in terms of stars, gas and dust parameters. We find that the range of ionized-gas properties spanned by nearby galaxies implies factors of 3.5 and 14 variations in the Hα and [O ii] luminosities produced per unit star formation rate (SFR). When accounting for stellar Hα absorption and absorption by dust in the neutral ISM, the actual uncertainties in SFR estimates based on the emergent Hα and [O ii] luminosities are as high as several decades. We derive new estimators of the SFR, the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the effective absorption optical depth of the dust in galaxies. We show that, with the help of other lines such as [O ii], Hβ, [O iii], [N ii] or [S ii], the uncertainties in SFR estimates based on Hα can be reduced to a factor of only 2--3, even if the Hα line is blended with the adjacent [N ii] lines. Without Hα, however, the SFR is difficult to estimate from the [O ii], Hβ and [O iii] lines. The reason for this is that the absorption by dust in the neutral ISM and the ionized-gas parameters are then difficult to constrain independently. This suggests that, while insufficient by itself, the Hα line is essential for estimating the star formation rate from the optical emission of a galaxy.}},

	abstract = {We present a spectroscopic and photometric analysis of a sample of 416,288 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) matched to mid-infrared (mid-IR) data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). By using a new spectroscopic fitting package, GELATO (Galaxy/AGN Emission Line Analysis TOol), we are able to retrieve emission line fluxes and uncertainties for SDSS spectra and robustly determine the presence of broad lines and outflowing components, enabling us to investigate WISE color space as a function of optical spectroscopic properties. In addition, we pursue spectral energy distribution template fitting to assess the relative active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution and nuclear obscuration to compare to existing mid-IR selection criteria with WISE. We present a selection criterion in mid-IR color space to select AGNs with an ∼80% accuracy and a completeness of ∼16%. This is the first mid-IR color selection defined by solely using the distribution of Type I and Type II optical spectroscopic AGNs in WISE mid-IR color space. Our selection is an improvement of ∼50% in the completeness of targeting spectroscopic AGNs with WISE down to an SDSS r &lt; 17.77 mag. In addition, our new criterion targets a less-luminous population of AGNs, with on average lower [O iii] luminosities by ∼30% ( &gt; 0.1 dex) compared to typical WISE color--color selections. With upcoming large photometric surveys without corresponding spectroscopy, our method presents a way to select larger populations of AGNs at lower AGN luminosities and higher nuclear obscuration levels than traditional mid-IR color selections.},

	abstract = {Nearby, low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offer the best local analogs to study the early evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (BHs). Here we present a detailed multiwavelength investigation of star formation and BH activity in the low-metallicity dwarf--dwarf galaxy merger Mrk 709. Using Hubble Space Telescope Hα and continuum imaging combined with Keck spectroscopy, we determine that the two dwarf galaxies are likely in the early stages of a merger (i.e., their first pass) and discover a spectacular ∼10 kpc long string of young massive star clusters (t ≲ 10 Myr;  M ⋆ ≳ 105  M ⊙) between the galaxies triggered by the interaction. We find that the southern galaxy, Mrk 709 S, is undergoing a clumpy mode of star formation resembling that seen in high-redshift galaxies, with multiple young clusters/clumps having stellar masses between 107 and 108  M ⊙. Furthermore, we present additional evidence for a low-luminosity AGN in Mrk 709 S (first identified by Reines et al. using radio and X-ray observations), including the detection of the coronal [Fe x] optical emission line. The work presented here provides a unique glimpse into processes key to hierarchical galaxy formation and BH growth in the early universe.},

	abstract = {We present an entirely new sample of 388 low-mass galaxies (M ⋆ ≤ 1010 M ⊙) that have spectroscopic signatures indicating the presence of massive black holes (BHs) in the form of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or tidal disruption events. Of these, 70 have stellar masses in the dwarf galaxy regime with 108 ≲ M ⋆/M ⊙ ≲ 109.5. We identify the active galaxies by analyzing optical spectra of a parent sample of ∼23,000 low-mass emission-line galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey Data Release 4, and employing four different diagnostics based on narrow emission-line ratios and the detection of high-ionization coronal lines. We find that 47 of the 388 low-mass active galaxies exhibit broad Hα in their spectra, corresponding to virial BH masses in the range M BH ∼ 105.0--7.7 M ⊙ with a median BH mass of 〈M BH〉 ∼ 106.2 M ⊙. Our sample extends to higher redshifts (z ≤ 0.3; 〈z〉 = 0.13) than previous samples of AGNs in low-mass/dwarf galaxies based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, which can be attributed to the spectroscopic limit of GAMA being ∼2 mag deeper. Moreover, our multi-diagnostic approach has revealed low-mass active galaxies spanning a wide range of properties, from blue star-forming dwarfs to luminous ``miniquasars'' powered by low-mass BHs. As such, this work has implications for BH seeding and AGN feedback at low masses.},

Our sample is compiled from broad-line AGNs in dwarf galaxies reported in the literature with single-epoch virial black hole (BH) masses in the range MBH ∼ 104--108 M⊙. We measure the characteristic `damping' time-scale of the optical variability τDRW, beyond which the power spectral density flattens, of a final sample of 79 candidate low-mass AGNs with high-quality light curves. Our results provide further confirmation of the MBH--τDRW relation from previous work within 1σ agreement, adding 78 new low-mass AGNs to the relation. The agreement suggests that the virial BH mass estimates for these AGNs are generally reasonable. We expect that the optical light curve of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) to vary with a rest-frame damping time-scale of ∼tens of hours, which could enable detection and direct mass estimation of accreting IMBHs in wide-field time-domain imaging surveys with sufficient cadence like with the Vera C.

Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton Observatory, we that find 11/23 nuclei are X-ray detected. We use spectral energy distribution modeling to compute star formation rates and show that the X-ray luminosities are typically in excess of the X-ray emission expected from star formation by at least an order of magnitude. Interestingly, this sample shows a diversity of optical spectroscopic properties. We explore possible reasons for why some objects lack optical spectroscopic signatures of black hole activity while still being UV-variable and X-ray bright. We find that host galaxy stellar emission and obscuration from gas and dust are potential factors. We study where this sample falls on relationships such as α OX − L 2500 and L X − L IR and find that some of the sample falls outside the typical scatter for these relations, indicating that they differ from the standard quasar population. With the diversity of optical spectroscopic signatures and varying impacts of dust and stellar emissions on our sample, these results emphasize the strength of variability in selecting the most complete set of AGN, regardless of other host galaxy properties.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic column density (NH) distribution of quasars is poorly known. At the high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z &lt; 1, the X-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurements that extend to energies above 10 keV. Using the hard X-ray observatory NuSTAR, along with archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data, we study the broad-band X-ray spectra of nine optically selected (from the SDSS), candidate Compton-thick (NH &gt; 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) type 2 quasars (CTQSO2s); five new NuSTAR observations are reported herein, and four have been previously published. The candidate CTQSO2s lie at z &lt; 0.5, have observed [O iii] luminosities in the range , and show evidence for extreme, Compton-thick absorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. Among the nine candidate CTQSO2s, five are detected by NuSTAR in the high-energy (8--24 keV) band: two are weakly detected at the ≈3σ confidence level and three are strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (≳90 net source counts at 8--24 keV). For these NuSTAR-detected sources direct (i.e., X-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic active galactic nucleus properties are feasible, and we measure column densities ≈2.5--1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed) X-ray luminosities ≈10--70 times higher than pre-NuSTAR constraints from Chandra and XMM-Newton. Assuming the NuSTAR-detected type 2 quasars are representative of other Compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the NH distribution for optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by Chandra and XMM-Newton for 39 objects. With this approach, we predict a Compton-thick fraction of  %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible if indirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.},

	abstract = {A large population of heavily obscured, Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is predicted by AGN synthesis models for the cosmic X-ray background and by the ``relic'' supermassive black hole mass function measured from local bulges. However, even the deepest X-ray surveys are inefficient to search for these elusive AGNs. Alternative selection criteria, combining mid-infrared with near-infrared, and optical photometry, have instead been successful in pinpointing a large population of Compton-thick AGNs. We take advantage of the deep Chandra and Spitzer coverage of a large area (more than 10 times the area covered by the Chandra deep fields, CDFs) in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field to extend the search of highly obscured, Compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. These sources have low surface density, and therefore large samples can be provided only through large area surveys, like the COSMOS survey. We analyze the X-ray properties of COSMOS MIPS sources with 24 μm fluxes higher than 550 μJy. For the MIPS sources not directly detected in the Chandra images, we produce stacked images in soft and hard X-rays bands. To estimate the fraction of Compton-thick AGN in the MIPS source population, we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardness ratios to those predicted by detailed Monte Carlo simulations, including both obscured AGN and star-forming galaxies. The volume density of Compton-thick QSOs (log L(2--10 keV) = 44--45 erg s−1, or logλLλ(5.8 μm) = 44.79--46.18 erg s−1 for a typical infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio) evaluated in this way is (4.8 $\pm$ 1.1) × 10−6 Mpc−3 in the redshift bin 1.2--2.2. This density is ∼44% of all X-ray-selected QSOs in the same redshift and luminosity bin, and it is consistent with the expectation of the most up-to-date AGN synthesis models for the cosmic X-ray background (Gilli et al. 2007). The density of lower luminosity Compton-thick AGNs (log L(2--10 keV) = 43.5--44) at z = 0.7--1.2 is (3.7 $\pm$ 1.1) × 10−5 Mpc−3, corresponding to ∼67% of X-ray-selected AGNs. The comparison between the fraction of infrared-selected, Compton-thick AGNs to the X-ray selected, unobscured, and moderately obscured AGNs at high and low luminosity suggests that Compton-thick AGNs follow a luminosity dependence similar to that discovered for Compton-thin AGNs, becoming relatively rarer at high luminosities. We estimate that the fraction of AGNs (unobscured, moderately obscured, and Compton thick) to the total MIPS source population is 49 $\pm$ 10%, a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24 μm fluxes. We discuss how our findings can constrain AGN feedback models.},

We also present an analysis of the physical properties of 189 star-forming galaxies with strong  emissions. These star-forming galaxies provide constraints on the hard ionizing continuum of massive stars.

	abstract = { ▪ Abstract The temporal evolution of the optical spectra of various types of supernovae (SNe) is illustrated, in part to aid observers classifying supernova candidates. Type II SNe are defined by the presence of hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient SNe (Type I), three subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si II (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si II nor He I (Ic). The late-time spectra of SNe Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although SNe Ia, which result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. SNe Ib/Ic probably result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically related to SNe II. Indeed, the progenitors of some SNe II seem to have only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric subclasses (linear and plateau) of SNe II, which may exhibit minor spectroscopic differences, there is a new subclass (SNe IIn) distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves. These objects probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact. },

The sources found by deep surveys are described along with their redshift and luminosity distributions, and the effectiveness of such surveys at selecting active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assessed. Some key results from deep surveys are highlighted, including (a) measurements of AGN evolution and the growth of supermassive black holes, (b) constraints on the demography and physics of high-redshift AGN, (c) the X-ray AGN content of infrared and submillimeter galaxies, and (d) X-ray emission from distant starburst and normal galaxies. We also describe some outstanding problems and future prospects for deep extragalactic X-ray surveys. },

	abstract = {We investigate why half of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in deep surveys lack signs of accretion in their optical spectra. The majority of these "optically dull" AGNs are no more than ~6 times fainter than their host galaxies in rest-frame R band; as such, AGN lines are unlikely to be overwhelmed by stellar continuum in at least half the sample. We find that optically dull AGNs have the mid-infrared emission and LX/LIR ratios characteristic of local Seyfert galaxies, suggesting that the cause of optical dullness is not missing UV-optical continua. We compare the morphologies of 22 optically dull and 9 optically active AGNs at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and find that optically dull AGNs show a wide range of axis ratio, but optically active AGNs have only very round axis ratios. We conclude that hard X-rays select AGNs in host galaxies with a wide range of inclination angle, but only those AGNs in the most face-on or spheroidal host galaxies show optical emission lines. Thus, extranuclear dust in the host galaxy plays an important role in hiding the emission lines of optically dull AGNs.},

@article{agostino2021,
	abstract = {Ionization sources other than H ii regions give rise to the right-hand branch in the standard ([N ii]) BPT diagram, populated by Seyfert 2s and LINERs. However, because the majority of Seyfert/LINER hosts are star-forming (SF), H ii regions contaminate the observed lines to some extent, making it unclear if the position along the branch is merely due to various degrees of mixing between pure Seyferts/LINERs and SF, or whether it reflects the intrinsic diversity of Seyfert/LINER ionizing sources. In this study, we empirically remove SF contributions in ∼100,000 Seyferts/LINERs from SDSS using the doppelganger method. We find that mixing is not the principal cause of the extended morphology of the observed branch. Rather, Seyferts/LINERs intrinsically have a wide range of line ratios. Variations in ionization parameter and metallicity can account for much of the diversity of Seyfert/LINER line ratios, but the hardness of the ionization field also varies significantly. Furthermore, our k-means classification on seven decontaminated emission lines reveals that LINERs are made up of two populations, which we call soft and hard LINERs. The Seyfert 2s differ from both types of LINERs primarily by higher ionization parameter, whereas the two LINER types mainly differ from each other (and from star-forming regions) in the hardness of the radiation field. We confirm that the [N ii] BPT diagram more efficiently identifies LINERs than [S ii] and [O i] diagnostics, because in the latter many LINERs, especially soft ones, occupy the same location as pure starformers, even after the SF has been removed from LINER emission.},

Our atlas spans a broad range of galaxy types, including ellipticals, spirals, merging galaxies, blue compact dwarfs, and luminous infrared galaxies. We have combined ground-based optical drift-scan spectrophotometry with infrared spectroscopy from Spitzer and Akari with gaps in spectral coverage being filled using Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties spectral energy distribution models. The spectroscopy and models were normalized, constrained, and verified with matched-aperture photometry measured from Swift, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Spitzer, and Wide-field Infrared Space Explorer images. The availability of 26 photometric bands allowed us to identify and mitigate systematic errors present in the data. Comparison of our spectral energy distributions with other template libraries and the observed colors of galaxies indicates that we have smaller systematic errors than existing atlases, while spanning a broader range of galaxy types. Relative to the prior literature, our atlas will provide improved K-corrections, photometric redshifts, and star-formation rate calibrations.},

	abstract = {In this study, we use the Swift/BAT AGN sample, which has received extensive multiwavelength follow-up analysis as a result of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, to develop a diagnostic for nuclear obscuration by examining the relationship between the line-of-sight column densities (N H), the 2--10 keV to 12 μm luminosity ratio, and WISE mid-infrared colors. We demonstrate that heavily obscured AGNs tend to exhibit both preferentially ``redder'' mid-infrared colors and lower values of L X,Obs./L 12 μm than less obscured AGNs, and we derive expressions relating N H to the L X,Obs./L 12 μm and L 22 μm/L 4.6 μm luminosity ratios, as well as develop diagnostic criteria using these ratios. Our diagnostic regions yield samples that are ≳80% complete and ≳60% pure for AGNs with log(N H/cm−2) ≥ 24, as well as ≳85% pure for AGNs with . We find that these diagnostics cannot be used to differentiate between optically star-forming galaxies and active galaxies. Further, mid-IR contributions from host galaxies that dominate the observed 12 μm emission can lead to larger apparent X-ray deficits and redder mid-IR colors than the AGNs would intrinsically exhibit, though this effect helps to better separate less and more obscured AGNs. Finally, we test our diagnostics on two catalogs of AGNs and infrared galaxies, including the XMM-Newton XXL-N field, and we identify several known Compton-thick AGNs, as well as a handful of candidate heavily obscured AGNs based upon our proposed obscuration diagnostics.},

Our analyses are based on the detection of the high-excitation emission line [Ne v]λ14.32 μm (97.1 eV) to unambiguously identify AGN activity. We find that 17 of the 64 infrared (IR) bright galaxies in our sample host AGN activity (≈27+8−6 per cent), ?50 per cent of which are not identified as AGN using optical spectroscopy. The large AGN fraction indicates a tighter connection between AGN activity and IR luminosity for galaxies in the local Universe than previously found, potentially indicating a close association between AGN activity and star formation. The optically unidentified AGN span a wide range of galaxy type (S0--Ir) and are typically starburst-dominated systems hosting modest-luminosity AGN activity (L[Ne V]≈ 1037--1039 erg s−1). The non-identification of optical AGN signatures in the majority of these galaxies appears to be due to extinction towards the AGN, rather than intrinsically low-luminosity AGN activity; however, we note that the AGN optical signatures are diluted in some galaxies due to strong star formation activity. Examination of optical images shows that the optically unidentified AGN with evidence for extinction are hosted in either highly inclined galaxies or galaxies with dust lanes, indicating that obscuration of the AGN is not necessarily due to an obscuring torus. We therefore conclude that optical spectroscopic surveys miss approximately half of the AGN population simply due to extinction through the host galaxy.}},

	abstract = {The fraction of active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity obscured by dust and re-emitted in the mid-IR is critical for understanding AGN evolution, unification, and parsec-scale AGN physics. For unobscured (Type 1) AGNs, where we have a direct view of the accretion disk, the dust covering factor can be measured by computing the ratio of re-processed mid-IR emission to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity. We use this technique to estimate the obscured AGN fraction as a function of luminosity and redshift for 513 Type 1 AGNs from the XMM-COSMOS survey. The re-processed and intrinsic luminosities are computed by fitting the 18 band COSMOS photometry with a custom spectral energy distribution fitting code, which jointly models emission from hot dust in the AGN torus, from the accretion disk, and from the host galaxy. We find a relatively shallow decrease of the luminosity ratio as a function of Lbol, which we interpret as a corresponding decrease in the obscured fraction. In the context of the receding torus model, where dust sublimation reduces the covering factor of more luminous AGNs, our measurements require a torus height that increases with luminosity as . Our obscured-fraction--luminosity relation agrees with determinations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey censuses of Type 1 and Type 2 quasars and favors a torus optically thin to mid-IR radiation. We find a much weaker dependence of the obscured fraction on 2--10 keV luminosity than previous determinations from X-ray surveys and argue that X-ray surveys miss a significant population of highly obscured Compton-thick AGNs. Our analysis shows no clear evidence for evolution of the obscured fraction with redshift.},

	abstract = {{We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour--magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.}},

For a strategic survey of such galaxies and the interpretation of the obtained data, this paper presents an ultraviolet-to-optical spectral model of galaxies with a great care of the nebular emission. In particular, we present a machine-readable table of intensities of 119 nebular emission lines from Lyα to the rest-frame 1 m as a function of metallicity from zero to the solar one. Based on the spectral model, we present criteria of equivalent widths of Lyα, He iiλ1640, Hα, Hβ and [O iii]λ5007 to select extremely metal-poor and metal-free galaxies although these criteria have uncertainty caused by the Lyman continuum escape fraction and the star formation duration. We also present criteria of broad-band colours which will be useful to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up from drop-out galaxies. We propose the line intensity ratio of [O iii]λ5007 to Hβ \\&lt; 0.1 as the most robust criterion for \\&lt;1/1000 of the solar metallicity. This ratio of a galaxy with a few M⊙ yr−1 at z∼ 8 is detectable by spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope within a reasonable exposure time.}},

	abstract = {We present the results of an archival study of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) Astro-2 database. Nineteen spectra of star-forming regions and starburst galaxies were retrieved, reprocessed, and analyzed. The spectra cover the wavelength region 912-1800 {\AA}, providing access to the domain of peak luminosity from a young stellar population. We created an atlas of galaxy spectra documenting the continuum and line properties with an emphasis on the relatively unexplored spectral region below 1200 {\AA}. The dust obscuration law was derived from a comparison of the HUT spectra with synthetic population models. The law is similar to the commonly adopted starburst reddening curve at longer wavelengths and approaches the Milky Way law near the Lyman break. A simple power-law parameterization is given, which allows users to express the reddening law in terms of the stellar or nebular color excess at ultraviolet or optical wavelengths. The star formation histories were derived from the reddening-corrected continua and the ultraviolet line profiles. We find typical ages of tens of Myr and star formation densities ranging from less than 0.1 to more than 10 M⊙ yr-1 kpc-2. The absorbed ultraviolet luminosity correlates very well with the far-infrared luminosity, as expected if the dominant dust absorption occurs in a foreground screen. This correlation holds even for the most luminous galaxies in our sample, whose IRAS luminosity is in excess of 1011 L⊙.},

	abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ ≳ 40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T ~ 40-55 K (warm dust) and T ~ 20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ϵ = 2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as "UV bright," for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z ≳ 1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

	abstract = {Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory imaging of M31 is used, with a physical dust model, to construct maps of dust surface density, dust-to-gas ratio, starlight heating intensity, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, out to R ≈ 25 kpc. The global dust mass is Md = 5.4 × 107 M☉, the global dust/H mass ratio is Md/MH = 0.0081, and the global PAH abundance is 〈qPAH〉 = 0.039. The dust surface density has an inner ring at R = 5.6 kpc, a maximum at R = 11.2 kpc, and an outer ring at R ≈ 15.1 kpc. The dust/gas ratio varies from Md/MH ≈ 0.026 at the center to ∼0.0027 at R ≈ 25 kpc. From the dust/gas ratio, we estimate the interstellar medium metallicity to vary by a factor ∼10, from Z/Z☉ ≈ 3 at R = 0 to ∼0.3 at R = 25 kpc. The dust heating rate parameter 〈U〉 peaks at the center, with 〈U〉 ≈ 35, declining to 〈U〉 ≈ 0.25 at R = 20 kpc. Within the central kiloparsec, the starlight heating intensity inferred from the dust modeling is close to what is estimated from the stars in the bulge. The PAH abundance reaches a peak qPAH ≈ 0.045 at R ≈ 11.2 kpc. When allowance is made for the different spectrum of the bulge stars, qPAH for the dust in the central kiloparsec is similar to the overall value of qPAH in the disk. The silicate--graphite--PAH dust model used here is generally able to reproduce the observed dust spectral energy distribution across M31, but overpredicts 500 μm emission at R ≈ 2--6 kpc, suggesting that at R = 2--6 kpc, the dust opacity varies more steeply with frequency (with β ≈ 2.3 between 200 and 600 μm) than in the model.},

@article{chabrier2003,
	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present‐day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy---disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters---and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power‐law form for m≳1 M⊙ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc ∼ 0.08 M⊙ and a variance in logarithmic mass σ ∼ 0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc ∼ 0.2 M⊙ and σ ∼ 0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L‐ and T‐dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD ∼ n* ∼ 0.1 pc−3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages ≳130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick‐disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc ∼ 0.2--0.3 M⊙, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ∼1 M⊙. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present‐day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present‐day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass‐to‐light ratio determinations. The mass‐to‐light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8--1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans‐type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super‐Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large‐scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.},

	abstract = {{The primary source of emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the accretion disc, is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty structure (`the so-called dusty torus'). The infrared radiation emitted by the dust is nothing but a reprocessed fraction of the accretion disc emission, so the ratio of the torus to the AGN luminosity (Ltorus/LAGN) should corresponds to the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, i.e. the covering factor. We undertook a critical investigation of the Ltorus/LAGN as the dust covering factor proxy. Using state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we calculated a grid of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) emitted by the clumpy two-phase dusty structure. With this grid of SEDs, we studied the relation between Ltorus/LAGN and the dust covering factor for different parameters of the torus. We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus anisotropy makes Ltorus/LAGN underestimate low covering factors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs Ltorus/LAGN always underestimates covering factors. Our results provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain correct covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we demonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN fraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the dust covering factors show very weak dependence on LAGN, with values in the range of ≈0.6--0.7. Our results also suggest a higher fraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray surveys, in part owing to the presence of a Compton-thick AGN population predicted by population synthesis models.}},

Following theoretical predictions derived from hydrodynamical simulations, we model the dusty torus as a 3D two-phase medium with high-density clumps and low-density medium filling the space between the clumps. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images of the torus at different wavelengths are obtained using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code skirt. Our approach of generating clumpy structure allows us to model the tori with single clumps, complex structures of merged clumps or interconnected sponge-like structure. A corresponding set of clumps-only models and models with smooth dust distribution is calculated for comparison. We found that dust distribution, optical depth, clump size and their actual arrangement in the innermost region all have an impact on the shape of near- and mid-infrared SED. The 10-μm silicate feature can be suppressed for some parameters, but models with smooth dust distribution are also able to produce a wide range of silicate feature strength. Finally, we find that having the dust distributed in a two-phase medium might offer a natural solution to the lack of emission in near-infrared, compared to observed data, which affects clumpy models currently available in the literature.}},

We apply the autocorrelation function to two archival XMM--Newton observations to determine characteristic time-scales for variability of ∼13.52 and ∼14.35 ks. The modelling of light curves, both folded at these time-scales and unfolded, indicates that a Gaussian model is preferable over a sinusoidal model, with average durations for the bright phases of 6.17 and 7.69 ks. In a broad 0.2--1.0 keV band the average amplitude of the bright phases was found to be 2.86 and 8.56 times the quiescent count rate. The pattern of variability seen in 2XMM J123103.2+110648 cannot be definitively declared as a series of QPEs. Instead, this suggests there may be a continuum of quasi-periodic variability ranging from eruptions to oscillations being caused by a single mechanism. This offers the possibility of finding further sources that continue to bridge the gap between QPEs and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). A targeted analysis of 47 observations of 11 other low-mass AGN (log (MBH) ≲ 6) found no evidence of QPE- or QPO-like behaviour in a sample of other similar mass objects.}},

	abstract = {We have obtained Keck near-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of nine M ⋆ &lt; 1010  M ⊙ dwarf galaxies to confirm active galactic nuclei (AGNs) activity and the presence of galaxy-wide, AGN-driven outflows through coronal line (CL) emission. We find strong CL detections in 5/9 galaxies (55%) with line ratios incompatible with shocks, confirming the presence of AGNs in these galaxies. Similar CL detection rates are found in larger samples of more massive galaxies hosting type 1 and 2 AGNs. We investigate the connection between the CLs and galaxy-wide outflows by analyzing the kinematics of the CL region as well as the scaling of gas velocity with ionization potential of different CLs. In addition, using complementary Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of these objects, we find that the outflow velocities measured in [Si vi] are generally faster than those seen in [O iii]. The galaxies with the fastest outflows seen in [O iii] also have the highest [Si vi] luminosity. The lack of J-band CN absorption features, which are often associated with younger stellar populations, provides further evidence that these outflows are driven by AGNs in low-mass galaxies.},

	abstract = {Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ∼ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O iii]/Hβ versus [S ii]/Hα diagram (S ii plot) and [O iii]/Hβ versus [O i]/Hα diagram (O i plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O iii]/Hβ versus [N ii]/Hα diagnostic (N ii plot or ``BPT diagram''). We identify a new category of ``star-forming AGN'' (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N ii plot but as AGN by the S ii and/or O i plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ∼ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ∼3%--16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (∼1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ∼0.6%--3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;1011.5 M ⊙, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z ≲ 0.4 Z ⊙), demonstrating the advantage of our method.},

	abstract = {We present high-quality (high signal-to-noise ratio and moderate spectral resolution) near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopic observations of 23 well-known broad emission line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In addition, we obtained simultaneous (within 2 months) optical spectroscopy of similar quality. The near-IR broad emission line spectrum of AGNs is dominated by permitted transitions of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and calcium, and by the rich spectrum of singly ionized iron. In this paper we present the spectra, line identifications, and measurements, and we address briefly some of the important issues regarding the physics of AGN broad emission line regions. In particular, we investigate the excitation mechanism of neutral oxygen and confront for the first time theoretical predictions of the near-IR iron emission spectrum with observations.},

	abstract = {A primary aim of the  (NuSTAR) mission is to find and characterize heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Based on mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, we have selected a large population of luminous obscured AGNs (i.e., ``obscured quasars''). Here we report NuSTAR observations of four WISE-selected heavily obscured quasars for which we have optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatory. Optical diagnostics confirm that all four targets are AGNs. With NuSTAR hard X-ray observations, three of the four objects are undetected, while the fourth has a marginal detection. We confirm that these objects have observed hard X-ray (10--40 keV) luminosities at or below ∼1043 erg s−1. We compare X-ray and IR luminosities to obtain estimates of the hydrogen column densities (NH) based on the suppression of the hard X-ray emission. We estimate NH of these quasars to be at or larger than 1025 cm−2, confirming that WISE and optical selection can identify very heavily obscured quasars that may be missed in X-ray surveys, and they do not contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background. From the optical Balmer decrements, we found that our three extreme obscured targets lie in highly reddened host environments. This galactic extinction cannot adequately explain the more obscured AGNs, but it may imply a different scale of obscuration in the galaxy.},

@article{strubbe2009,
	abstract = {{A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH) is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ∼10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH∼ 105--106 M⊙ and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs.}},

@article{cao2018,
	abstract = {{In the canonical model for tidal disruption events (TDEs), the stellar debris circularizes quickly to form an accretion disc of size about twice the orbital pericentre of the star. Most TDEs and candidates discovered in the optical/ultraviolet have broad optical emission lines with complex and diverse profiles of puzzling origin. Liu et al. recently developed a relativistic elliptical disc model of constant eccentricity in radius for the broad optical emission lines of TDEs and well reproduced the double-peaked line profiles of the TDE candidate PTF09djl with a large and extremely eccentric accretion disc. In this paper, we show that the optical emission lines of the TDE ASASSN-14li with radically different profiles are well modelled with the relativistic elliptical disc model, too. The accretion disc of ASASSN-14li has an eccentricity 0.97 and semimajor axis of 847 times the Schwarzschild radius (rS) of the black hole (BH). It forms as the consequence of tidal disruption of a star passing by a massive BH with orbital pericentre 25rS. The optical emission lines of ASASSN-14li are powered by an extended X-ray source of flat radial distribution overlapping the bulk of the accretion disc and the single-peaked asymmetric line profiles are mainly due to the orbital motion of the emitting matter within the disc plane of inclination about 26$\,^{\circ}$ and of pericentre orientation closely toward the observer. Our results suggest that modelling the complex line profiles is powerful in probing the structures of accretion discs and coronal X-ray sources in TDEs.}},

@article{wang2012,
	abstract = {Tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies is expected to produce unique emission-line signatures, which have not yet been explored adequately. Here we report the discovery of extremely strong coronal lines from [Fe x] up to [Fe xiv] in a sample of seven galaxies (including two recently reported cases), which we interpret as such signatures. This is the first systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use of the immense database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxies, which are non-active as evidenced by the narrow line ratios, show broad emission lines of complex profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the high-ionization coronal lines and the broad lines are fading on timescales of years in objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolute magnitudes of at least −16 to −18 mag in the g band, are also detected in more than half of the sample. The coronal line emitters reside in sub-L* disk galaxies (−21.3 &lt; Mi &lt; −18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions. The sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence of the [Fe vii] lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [O iii], [Fe xi], and the host galaxies. These characteristics can most naturally be understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such events to be around 10−5 yr−1 for a galaxy with −21.3 &lt; Mi &lt; −18.5.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of superstrong, fading, high-ionization iron line emission in the galaxy SDSS J095209.56+214313.3 (SDSS J0952+2143 hereafter), which must have been caused by an X-ray outburst of large amplitude. SDSS J0952+2143 is unique in its strong multiwavelength variability; such a broadband emission-line and continuum response has not been observed before. The strong iron line emission is accompanied by unusual Balmer line emission with a broad base, narrow core, and double-peaked narrow horns, and strong He II emission. These lines, while strong in the SDSS spectrum taken in 2005, have faded away significantly in new spectra taken in 2007 December. Comparison of SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX, and follow-up GROND photometry reveals variability in the NUV, optical, and NIR band. Taken together, these unusual observations can be explained by a giant outburst in the EUV-X-ray band, detected even in the optical and NIR. The intense and variable iron, helium, and Balmer lines represent the ``light echo'' of the flare, as it traveled through circumnuclear material. The outburst may have been caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. Spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS are well suited to detect emission-line light echoes of such rare flare events. Reverberation-mapping of these light echoes can then be used as a new and efficient probe of the physical conditions in the circumnuclear material in nonactive or active galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present 0.5--8.0 keV Chandra observations of six bright quasars that represent extrema in quasar emission-line properties---three quasars each with small and large blueshifts of the C IV emission line with respect to the systemic redshift of the quasars. Supplemented with seven archival Chandra observations of quasars that met our selection criteria, we investigate the origin of this emission-line phenomenon in the general context of the structure of quasars. We find that the quasars with the largest C IV blueshifts show evidence, from joint spectral fitting, for intrinsic X-ray absorption (NH ∼ 1022 cm-2). Given the lack of accompanying C IV absorption, this gas is likely to be highly ionized and may be identified with the shielding gas in the disk-wind paradigm. Furthermore, we find evidence for a correlation of αUV, the ultraviolet spectral index, with the hardness of the X-ray continuum; an analysis of independent Bright Quasar Survey data from the literature supports this conclusion. This result points to intrinsically red quasars having systematically flatter hard X-ray continua without evidence for X-ray absorption. We speculate on the origins of these correlations of X-ray properties with both C IV blueshift and αUV and discuss the implications for models of quasar structure.},

	abstract = {We carry out classification of 4330 X-ray sources in the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog. They are selected under the requirement of being a point source with multiple XMM-Newton observations and at least one detection with the signal-to-noise ratio larger than 20. For about one-third of them we are able to obtain reliable source types from the literature. They mostly correspond to various types of stars (611), active galactic nuclei (AGNs, 753), and compact object systems (138) containing white dwarfs, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. We find that about 99% of stars can be separated from other source types based on their low X-ray-to-IR flux ratios and frequent X-ray flares. AGNs have remarkably similar X-ray spectra, with the power-law photon index centered around 1.91 $\pm$ 0.31, and their 0.2--4.5 keV flux long-term variation factors have a median of 1.48, with 98.5% being less than 10. In contrast, 70% of compact object systems can be very soft or hard, highly variable in X-rays, and/or have very large X-ray-to-IR flux ratios, separating them from AGNs. Using these results, we derive a source type classification scheme to classify the other sources and find 644 candidate stars, 1376 candidate AGNs, and 202 candidate compact object systems, whose false identification probabilities are estimated to be about 1%, 3%, and 18%, respectively. There are still 320 sources associated with nearby galaxies and 151 in the Galactic plane, which we expect to be mostly compact object systems or background AGNs. We also have 100 candidate ultraluminous X-ray sources. They are found to be much less variable than other accreting compact objects.},

	abstract = {We searched the northern hemisphere fields of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Time Domain Survey for galaxies with UV variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We identified 48 high-probability candidate AGNs from a parent sample of 1819 galaxies in the NASA Sloan Atlas catalog. We further characterized these systems using optical spectroscopic diagnostics, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer IR color selection criteria, and spectral energy distribution modeling. Of the 48 candidates, eight were identified as AGNs from optical emission lines, two were identified by their IR colors, and 28 were identified through spectral energy decomposition. Observational biases of each selection method are discussed in connecting these AGN subsamples to another. By selecting AGNs based on UV variability, we also identified six low-mass AGN candidates, all of which would have been missed by spectroscopic selection.},

Both light seed formation channels remnants of the first stars and the more massive direct collapse seed formation scenarios are outlined. In particular, the focus is on the implications of these various scenarios and what these initial conditions imply for the highest redshift black holes, the local black hole population, the highest mass black holes at each epoch and the low mass end of the black hole mass function all of which are currently observed. The goal is to present a broad and comprehensive picture of the current status; the open questions and challenges faced by black hole growth models in matching current observational data and the prospects for future observations that will help discriminate between competing models.},

	abstract = {We present a sample of hard X-ray-selected candidate black holes (BHs) in 19 dwarf galaxies. BH candidates are identified by cross-matching a parent sample of ∼44,000 local dwarf galaxies ( , ) with the Chandra Source Catalog and subsequently analyzing the original X-ray data products for matched sources. Of the 19 dwarf galaxies in our sample, eight have X-ray detections reported here for the first time. We find a total of 43 point-like hard X-ray sources with individual luminosities erg s−1. Hard X-ray luminosities in this range can be attained by stellar-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) and by massive BHs accreting at low Eddington ratio. We place an upper limit of 53% (10/19) on the fraction of galaxies in our sample hosting a detectable hard X-ray source consistent with the optical nucleus, although the galaxy center is poorly defined in many of our objects. We also find that 42% (8/19) of the galaxies in our sample exhibit statistically significant enhanced hard X-ray emission relative to the expected galaxy-wide contribution from low-mass and high-mass XRBs, based on the star formation rate relation defined by more massive and luminous systems. For the majority of these X-ray-enhanced dwarf galaxies, the excess emission is consistent with (but not necessarily due to) a nuclear X-ray source. Follow-up observations are necessary to distinguish between stellar-mass XRBs and active galactic nuclei powered by more massive BHs. In any case, our results support the notion that X-ray-emitting BHs in low-mass dwarf galaxies may have had an appreciable impact on reionization in the early universe.},

	abstract = { Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by the accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and are among the most luminous objects in the Universe. However, the huge radiative power of most AGN cannot be seen directly, as the accretion is hidden behind gas and dust that absorb many of the characteristic observational signatures. This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology. We conclude with an outline of the prospects for future progress from both observations and theoretical models, and we highlight some of the key outstanding questions. },

	abstract = {{The origin and properties of the initial black hole seeds that grow to produce the observed population of accreting sources remain to be determined. It is a challenge to uniquely disentangle signatures of seeding from fuelling and dynamics that shapes the assembly history of growing black holes. To address this, we use a semi-analytic model developed to track the growth of supermassive black holes adopting multiple prescriptions for accretion. In contrast with earlier treatments, we explore the interplay between seeding models and two accretion modes. We find that signatures of the initial seeding do survive in the following observational probes: the black hole occupation fraction; contribution to the unresolved X-ray background; low-luminosity and high-redshift luminosity functions; and gravitational wave event signatures. We find that the behaviour of the low-mass end of the M*--σ relation is dominated by uncertainties in the adopted accretion prescriptions and does not offer clear discrimination between seeding models. We make concrete predictions for future surveys, particularly for the Lynx X-ray surveyor and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, which will each provide different and yet strong constraints on the seed population. Black hole coalescences detected by LISA and high-redshift quasar luminosity functions observed by Lynx will offer the sharpest seeding discriminants. Although the signatures of the black hole seeding mechanism that persist remain linked to our understanding of black hole accretion and dynamics, we offer new insights on how these upcoming multiwavelength observations could be leveraged to effectively disentangle them.}},

	abstract = {Evidence shows that massive black holes reside in most local galaxies. Studies have also established a number of relations between the MBH mass and properties of the host galaxy such as bulge mass and velocity dispersion. These results suggest that central MBHs, while much less massive than the host (\~{}0.1{\%}), are linked to the evolution of galactic structure. In hierarchical cosmologies, a single big galaxy today can be traced back to the stage when it was split up in hundreds of smaller components. Did MBH seeds form with the same efficiency in small proto-galaxies, or did their formation had to await the buildup of substantial galaxies with deeper potential wells? I briefly review here some of the physical processes that are conducive to the evolution of the massive black hole population. I will discuss black hole formation processes for `seed'black holes that are likely to place at early cosmic epochs, and possible observational tests of these scenarios.},

	abstract = {We characterize the optical variability of quasars in the Palomar Transient Factory and intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (PTF/iPTF) surveys. We re-calibrate the r-band light curves for ∼28,000 luminous, broad-line active galactic nuclei from the SDSS, producing a total of ∼2.4 million photometric data points. We utilize both the structure function (SF) and power spectrum density (PSD) formalisms to search for links between the optical variability and the physical parameters of the accreting supermassive black holes that power the quasars. The excess variance (SF2) of the quasar sample tends to zero at very short time separations, validating our re-calibration of the time-series data. We find that the the amplitude of variability at a given time-interval, or equivalently the timescale of variability to reach a certain amplitude, is most strongly correlated with luminosity with weak or no dependence on black hole mass and redshift. For a variability level of SF(τ) = 0.07 mag, the timescale has a dependency of . This is broadly consistent with the expectation from a simple Keplerian accretion disk model, which provides . The PSD analysis also reveals that many quasar light curves are steeper than a damped random walk. We find a correlation between the steepness of the PSD slopes, specifically the fraction of slopes steeper than 2.5, and black hole mass, although we cannot exclude the possibility that luminosity or Eddington ratio are the drivers of this effect. This effect is also seen in the SF analysis of the (i)PTF data, and in a PSD analysis of quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82.},

@article{macleod2011,
	abstract = {We develop a method for separating quasars from other variable point sources using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 light-curve data for ∼ 10,000 variable objects. To statistically describe quasar variability, we use a damped random walk model parametrized by a damping timescale, τ, and an asymptotic amplitude (structure function), SF∞. With the aid of an SDSS spectroscopically confirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typical extragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples with reasonable purity (or efficiency, E). Compared to a selection method based solely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the τ information boosts E from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample (98%) even in the absence of color information. For a completeness of C = 90%, E is boosted from 80% to 85%. Conversely, C improves from 90% to 97% while maintaining E = 80% when imposing a lower limit on τ. With the aid of color selection, the purity can be further boosted to 96%, with C = 93%. Hence, selection methods based on variability will play an important role in the selection of quasars with data provided by upcoming large sky surveys, such as Pan-STARRS and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). For a typical (simulated) LSST cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag (achieved at i ≈ 22), C is expected to be 88% for a simple sample selection criterion of τ>100 days. In summary, given an adequate survey cadence, photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection for separating quasars from stars.},

@article{kormendy2013,
	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion sigma of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade.   New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M&sun; are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.   The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = { We describe ongoing searches for intermediate-mass black holes with MBH ≈ 10--105 M⊙. We review a range of search mechanisms, both dynamical and those that rely on accretion signatures. We find the following conclusions: ▪ Dynamical and accretion signatures alike point to a high fraction of 109--1010 M⊙ galaxies hosting black holes with MBH∼ 105 M⊙. In contrast, there are no solid detections of black holes in globular clusters. ▪ There are few observational constraints on black holes in any environment with MBH ≈ 100--104 M⊙. ▪ Considering low-mass galaxies with dynamical black hole masses and constraining limits, we find that the MBH--σ* relation continues unbroken to MBH ∼105 M⊙, albeit with large scatter. We believe the scatter is at least partially driven by a broad range in black hole masses, because the occupation fraction appears to be relatively high in these galaxies. ▪ We fold the observed scaling relations with our empirical limits on occupation fraction and the galaxy mass function to put observational bounds on the black hole mass function in galaxy nuclei. ▪ We are pessimistic that local demographic observations of galaxy nuclei alone could constrain seeding mechanisms, although either high-redshift luminosity functions or robust measurements of off-nuclear black holes could begin to discriminate models. },

	abstract = {We describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the GR2 and GR3 data releases of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). These releases have identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over the GR1 data release. GALEX continues to survey the sky in the far-ultraviolet (FUV, ~154 nm) and near-ultraviolet (NUV, ~232 nm) bands, providing simultaneous imaging with a pair of photon-counting, microchannel plate, delay line readout detectors. These 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ field of view detectors are well suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent red rejection and negligible background. A dithered mode of observing and photon list output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline, entangling detector calibrations, and aspect reconstruction algorithms. Recent improvements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mAB in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We have detected a long-term drift of order 1% FUV and 6% NUV over the mission. Astrometric precision is of order 0.5″ rms in both bands. In this paper we provide the GALEX user with a broad overview of the calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release. Improvements are likely as the GALEX mission continues into an extended phase with a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities for guest investigations.},

	abstract = {{We present an analysis of the host properties of 85 224 emission-line galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus--H ii (AGN--H ii) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [O iii] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [O iii] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[O iii]/σ4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixedL[O iii]/σ4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.}},

	abstract = {We present the selection and classification of over a thousand ultraviolet (UV) variable sources discovered in ∼40 deg2 of GALEX Time Domain Survey (TDS) NUV images observed with a cadence of 2 days and a baseline of observations of ∼3 years. The GALEX TDS fields were designed to be in spatial and temporal coordination with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey, which provides deep optical imaging and simultaneous optical transient detections via image differencing. We characterize the GALEX photometric errors empirically as a function of mean magnitude, and select sources that vary at the 5σ level in at least one epoch. We measure the statistical properties of the UV variability, including the structure function on timescales of days and years. We report classifications for the GALEX TDS sample using a combination of optical host colors and morphology, UV light curve characteristics, and matches to archival X-ray, and spectroscopy catalogs. We classify 62% of the sources as active galaxies (358 quasars and 305 active galactic nuclei), and 10% as variable stars (including 37 RR Lyrae, 53 M dwarf flare stars, and 2 cataclysmic variables). We detect a large-amplitude tail in the UV variability distribution for M-dwarf flare stars and RR Lyrae, reaching up to |Δm| = 4.6 mag and 2.9 mag, respectively. The mean amplitude of the structure function for quasars on year timescales is five times larger than observed at optical wavelengths. The remaining unclassified sources include UV-bright extragalactic transients, two of which have been spectroscopically confirmed to be a young core-collapse supernova and a flare from the tidal disruption of a star by dormant supermassive black hole. We calculate a surface density for variable sources in the UV with NUV < 23 mag and |Δm| > 0.2 mag of ∼8.0, 7.7, and 1.8 deg−2 for quasars, active galactic nuclei, and RR Lyrae stars, respectively. We also calculate a surface density rate in the UV for transient sources, using the effective survey time at the cadence appropriate to each class, of ∼15 and 52 deg−2 yr−1 for M dwarfs and extragalactic transients, respectively.},

	abstract = {{We review some practical aspects of measuring the amplitude of variability in `red noise' light curves typical of those from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in AGN light curves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, Fvar, and excess variance, σ2XS, are examined. Their statistical properties, relationship to the power spectrum and uses for investigating the nature of the variability processes are discussed. We demonstrate that σ2XS (or similarly Fvar) shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the variability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of these estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between different sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. Some examples of the expected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical power spectral shapes, based on Monte Carlo simulations. The excess variance can be useful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different energy bands from the same observation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to derive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected between different energy bands (due to measurement errors). Finally, these estimators are used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 766. The source is found to show a strong, linear correlation between rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.}},

@article{ulrich1997,
	abstract = { ▪ Abstract A large collective effort to study the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over the past decade has led to a number of fundamental results on radio-quiet AGN and blazars. In radio-quiet AGN, the ultraviolet (UV) bump in low-luminosity objects is thermal emission from a dense medium, very probably an accretion disk, irradiated by the variable X-ray source. The validity of this model for high-luminosity radio-quiet AGN is unclear because the relevant UV and X-ray observations are lacking. The broad-line gas kinematics appears to be dominated by virialized motions in the gravity field of a black hole, whose mass can be derived from the observed motions. The ``accretion disk plus wind'' model explains most of the variability (and other) data and appears to be the most appropriate model at present. Future investigations are outlined. In blazars, rapid variability at the highest energies (gamma-rays) implies that the whole continuum is relativistically boosted along the line of sight. The general correlation found between variations in TeV gamma rays and in X rays for Mrk 421, and between variations in GeV gamma rays and in the IR--optical--UV bands for 3C 279, two prototype objects, supports models in which the same population of relativistic electrons radiates the low-frequency continuum via synchrotron and the high frequency continuum via inverse Compton scattering of soft photons. Identifying the dominant source of soft photons, which is at present unclear, will strongly constrain the jet physics. },

	abstract = {An 8 month monitoring campaign on the Seyfert 1 galaxy Fairall 9 has been conducted with the International Ultraviolet Explorer in an attempt to obtain reliable estimates of continuum-continuum and continuum-emission-line delays for a high-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). While the results of this campaign are more ambiguous than those of previous monitoring campaigns on lower luminosity sources, we find general agreement with the earlier results: (1) there is no measurable lag between ultraviolet continuum bands, and (2) the measured emission-line time lags are very short. It is especially notable that the Lyα + N V emission-line lag is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than determined from a previous campaign by Clavel, Wamsteker, & Glass (1989) when Fairall 9 was in a more luminous state. In other well-monitored sources, specifically NGC 5548 and NGC 3783, the highest ionization lines are found to respond to continuum variations more rapidly than the lower ionization lines, which suggests a radially ionization-stratified broad-line region. In this case, the results are less certain, since none of the emission-line lags are very well determined. The best-determined emission line lag is Lyα + N V, for which we find that the centroid of the continuum-emission-line cross-correlation function is τcent ≈ 14-20 days. We measure a lag τcent ≲ 4 days for He II λ1640; this result is consistent with the ionization-stratification pattern seen in lower luminosity sources, but the relatively large uncertainties in the emission-line lags measured here cannot rule out similar lags for Lyα + N V and He II λ1640 at a high level of significance. We are unable to determine a reliable lag for C IV λ1550, but we note that the profiles of the variable parts of Lyα and C IV λ1550 are not the same, which does not support the hypothesis that the strongest variations in these two lines arise in the same region.},

	abstract = {We present an initial sample of 19 intermediate-mass black hole candidates in active galactic nuclei culled from the first data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the line width-luminosity mass scaling relation established for broad-line active nuclei, we estimate black hole masses in the range of MBH ≈ 8 × M☉, a regime in which only two objects are currently known. The absolute magnitudes are faint for active galactic nuclei, ranging from Mg ≈ -15 to -18 mag, while the bolometric luminosities are all close to the Eddington limit. The entire sample formally satisfies the line width criterion for so-called narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; however, they display a wider range of Fe II and [O III] λ5007 line strengths than is typically observed in this class of objects. Although the available imaging data are of insufficient quality to ascertain the detailed morphologies of the host galaxies, it is likely that the majority of the hosts are relatively late-type systems. The host galaxies have estimated g-band luminosities ~1 mag fainter than M* for the general galaxy population at z ≈ 0.1. Beyond simply extending the known mass range of central black holes in galactic nuclei, these objects provide unique observational constraints on the progenitors of supermassive black holes. They are also expected to contribute significantly to the integrated signal for future gravitational wave experiments.},

Although the main objectives of the survey are to search for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and to quantify their luminosity function, the database can be used for a variety of other purposes. This paper presents measurements of the spectroscopic parameters for the 418 emission-line nuclei, along with a compilation of the global properties of all 486 galaxies in the survey. Stellar absorption generally poses a serious obstacle to obtaining accurate measurement of emission lines in nearby galactic nuclei. We describe a procedure for removing the starlight from the observed spectra in an efficient and objective manner. The main parameters of the emission lines (intensity ratios, fluxes, profile widths, and equivalent widths) are measured and tabulated, as are several stellar absorption-line and continuum indices useful for studying the stellar population. Using standard nebular diagnostics, we determine the probable ionization mechanisms of the emission-line objects. The resulting spectral classifications provide extensive information on the demographics of emission-line nuclei in the nearby regions of the universe. This new catalog contains over 200 objects showing spectroscopic evidence for recent star formation and an equally large number of active galactic nuclei, including 46 that show broad Hα emission. These samples will serve as the basis of future studies of nuclear activity in nearby galaxies.},

The persistent luminosity of the broad Balmer emission indicates the galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with virial black hole masses of ∼106.7--107.0 M⊙. The lack of observed hard X-ray emission and the possibility that the Balmer emission could be due to a long-lived stellar transient motivated additional follow-up spectroscopy. We also identify a previously unreported blueshifted narrow absorption line in the broad H α feature in one of the AGNs, indicating an AGN-driven outflow with hydrogen column densities of order 1017 cm−2. We also extract light curves from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility. We detect probable AGN-like variability in three galaxies, further supporting the AGN scenario. This also suggests the AGNs are not strongly obscured. This sample of galaxies are among the most metal-poor that host an AGN (Z = 0.05--0.16 Z⊙). We speculate they may be analogues to seed black holes which formed in unevolved galaxies at high redshift. Given the rarity of metal-poor AGNs and small sample size available, we investigate prospects for their identification in future spectroscopic and photometric surveys.}},

	abstract = {We present the ultraviolet magnitudes for over three million stars in the LAMOST survey, in which 2,202,116 stars are detected by GALEX. For 889,235 undetected stars, we develop a method to estimate their upper limit magnitudes. The distribution of (FUV − NUV) shows that the color declines with increasing effective temperature for stars hotter than 7000 K in our sample, while the trend disappears for the cooler stars due to upper atmosphere emission from the regions higher than their photospheres. For stars with valid stellar parameters, we calculate the UV excesses with synthetic model spectra, and find that the (FUV − NUV) versus can be fitted with a linear relation and late-type dwarfs tend to have high UV excesses. There are 87,178 and 1,498,103 stars detected more than once in the visit exposures of GALEX in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We make use of the quantified photometric errors to determine statistical properties of the UV variation, including intrinsic variability and the structure function on the timescale of days. The overall occurrence of possible false positives is below 1.3% in our sample. UV absolute magnitudes are calculated for stars with valid parallaxes, which could serve as a possible reference frame in the NUV. We conclude that the colors related to UV provide good criteria to distinguish between M giants and M dwarfs, and the variability of RR Lyrae stars in our sample is stronger than that of other A and F stars.},

	abstract = {{As part of our ongoing archival X-ray survey of galaxy clusters for tidal flares, we present evidence of an X-ray transient source within 1 arcmin of the core of Abell 1795. The extreme variability (a factor of nearly 50), luminosity (\\&gt;2 × 1042 erg s−1), long duration (\\&gt;5 yr) and supersoft X-ray spectrum (\\&lt;0.1 keV) are characteristic signatures of a stellar tidal disruption event according to theoretical predictions and to existing X-ray observations, implying a massive ≳105 M{\.o} black hole at the centre of that galaxy. The large number of X-ray source counts (∼700) and long temporal baseline (∼12 yr with Chandra and XMM--Newton) make this one of the best sampled examples of any tidal flare candidate to date. The transient may be the same EUV source originally found contaminating the diffuse intracluster medium observations of Bowyer, Bergh{\"o}fer and Korpela, which would make it the only tidal flare candidate with reported EUV observations and implies an early source luminosity 1--2 orders of magnitude greater. If the host galaxy is a cluster member then it must be a dwarf galaxy, an order of magnitude less massive than the quiescent galaxy Henize 2--10 which hosts a massive black hole that is difficult to reconcile with its low mass. The unusual faintness of the host galaxy may be explained by tidal stripping in the cluster core.}},

@article{berk2004,
	abstract = {Using a sample of over 25,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show how quasar variability in the rest-frame optical/UV regime depends on rest-frame time lag, luminosity, rest wavelength, redshift, the presence of radio and X-ray emission, and the presence of broad absorption line systems. Imaging photometry is compared with three-band spectrophotometry obtained at later epochs spanning time lags up to about 2 yr. The large sample size and wide range of parameter values allow the dependence of variability to be isolated as a function of many independent parameters. The time dependence of variability (the structure function) is well fitted by a single power law with an index γ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.008, on timescales from days to years. There is an anticorrelation of variability amplitude with rest wavelength---e.g., quasars are about twice as variable at 1000 {\AA} as at 6000 {\AA}---and quasars are systematically bluer when brighter at all redshifts. There is a strong anticorrelation of variability with quasar luminosity---variability amplitude decreases by a factor of about 4 when luminosity increases by a factor of 100. There is also a significant positive correlation of variability amplitude with redshift, indicating evolution of the quasar population or the variability mechanism. We parameterize all of these relationships. Quasars with ROSAT All-Sky Survey X-ray detections are significantly more variable (at optical/UV wavelengths) than those without, and radio-loud quasars are marginally more variable than their radio-quiet counterparts. We find no significant difference in the variability of quasars with and without broad absorption line troughs. Currently, no models of quasar variability address more than a few of these relationships. Models involving multiple discrete events or gravitational microlensing are unlikely by themselves to account for the data. So-called accretion disk instability models are promising, but more quantitative predictions are needed.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a systematic search of low-mass black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad Hα emission lines, aiming at building a homogeneous sample that is more complete than previous ones for fainter, less highly accreting sources. For this purpose, we developed a set of elaborate, automated selection procedures and applied it uniformly to the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Special attention is given to AGN--galaxy spectral decomposition and emission-line deblending. We define a sample of 309 type 1 AGNs with BH masses in the range 8 × 104--2 × 106 M☉ (with a median of 1.2 × 106 M☉), using the virial mass estimator based on the broad Hα line. About half of our sample of low-mass BHs differs from that of Greene & Ho, with 61 of them discovered here for the first time. Our new sample picks up more AGNs with low accretion rates: the Eddington ratios of the present sample range from ≲ 0.01 to ∼1, with 30% below 0.1. This suggests that a significant fraction of low-mass BHs in the local universe are accreting at low rates. The host galaxies of the low-mass BHs have luminosities similar to those of L* field galaxies, optical colors of Sbc spirals, and stellar spectral features consistent with a continuous star formation history with a mean stellar age of less than 1 Gyr.},

	abstract = {Searching for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is important for our understanding of the seed black holes that formed in the early universe. Here, we test infrared selection methods for AGN activity at low galaxy masses. Our parent sample consists of ∼18,000 nearby dwarf galaxies (M* < 3 × 109 M☉, z < 0.055) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with significant detections in the first three bands of the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). First, we demonstrate that the majority of optically selected AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not selected as AGNs using WISE infrared color diagnostics and that the infrared emission is dominated by the host galaxies. We then investigate the infrared properties of optically selected star-forming dwarf galaxies, finding that the galaxies with the reddest infrared colors are the most compact, with blue optical colors, young stellar ages, and large specific star formation rates. These results indicate that great care must be taken when selecting AGNs in dwarf galaxies using infrared colors, as star-forming dwarf galaxies are capable of heating dust in such a way that mimics the infrared colors of more luminous AGNs. In particular, a simple color cut alone should not be used to select AGNs in dwarf galaxies. With these complications in mind, we present a sample of 41 dwarf galaxies that fall in the WISE infrared color space typically occupied by more luminous AGNs and that are worthy of follow-up observations.},

	abstract = {We have carried out a survey of the north and south ecliptic poles, EP-N and EP-S, respectively, with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The primary objective was to cross-calibrate WISE with the Spitzer and Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) photometric systems by developing a set of calibration stars that are common to these infrared missions. The ecliptic poles were continuous viewing zones for WISE due to its polar-crossing orbit, making these areas ideal for both absolute and internal calibrations. The Spitzer IRAC and MIPS imaging survey covers a complete area of 0.40 deg2 for the EP-N and 1.28 deg2 for the EP-S. WISE observed the whole sky in four mid-infrared bands, 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm, during its eight-month cryogenic mission, including several hundred ecliptic polar passages; here we report on the highest coverage depths achieved by WISE, an area of ∼1.5 deg2 for both poles. Located close to the center of the EP-N, the Sy-2 galaxy NGC 6552 conveniently functions as a standard calibrator to measure the red response of the 22 μm channel of WISE. Observations from Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS/IRS-LL and WISE show that the galaxy has a strong red color in the mid-infrared due to star-formation and the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), while over a baseline >1 year the mid-IR photometry of NGC 6552 is shown to vary at a level less than 2%. Combining NGC 6552 with the standard calibrator stars, the achieved photometric accuracy of the WISE calibration, relative to the Spitzer and MSX systems, is 2.4%, 2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.7% for W1 (3.4 μm), W2 (4.6 μm), W3 (12 μm), and W4 (22 μm), respectively. The WISE photometry is internally stable to better than 0.1% over the cryogenic lifetime of the mission. The secondary objective of the Spitzer--WISE Survey was to explore the poles at greater flux-level depths, exploiting the higher angular resolution Spitzer observations and the exceptionally deep (in total coverage) WISE observations that potentially reach down to the confusion limit of the survey. The rich Spitzer and WISE data sets were used to study the Galactic and extragalactic populations through source counts, color--magnitude and color--color diagrams. As an example of what the data sets facilitate, we have separated stars from galaxies, delineated normal galaxies from power-law-dominated AGNs, and reported on the different fractions of extragalactic populations. In the EP-N, we find an AGN source density of ∼260 deg−2 to a 12 μm depth of 115 μJy, representing 15% of the total extragalactic population to this depth, similar to what has been observed for low-luminosity AGNs in other fields.},

	abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an extremely capable and efficient black hole finder. We present a simple mid-infrared color criterion, W1 − W2 ⩾ 0.8 (i.e., [3.4]−[4.6] ⩾0.8, Vega), which identifies 61.9 $\pm$ 5.4 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates per deg2 to a depth of W2 ∼ 15.0. This implies a much larger census of luminous AGNs than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased toward only unobscured AGNs, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS field, we explore the properties of WISE-selected AGN candidates. At the mid-infrared depth considered, 160 μJy at 4.6 μm, this simple criterion identifies 78% of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria of Stern et al. and the reliability is 95%. We explore the demographics, multiwavelength properties and redshift distribution of WISE-selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [O iii]λ5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[O iii]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hδ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [O iii] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [O iii] luminosities.}},

In this Letter, we have modeled for the first time the dependence of the optical narrow emission line strengths on the black hole mass of accreting AGN over the range of . We show that as the black hole mass decreases, the hardening of the spectral energy distribution from the accretion disk changes the ionization structure of the nebula. The enhanced high-energy emission from IMBHs results in a more extended partially ionized zone compared with models for higher mass black holes. This effect produces a net decrease in the predicted [O iii]/Hβ and [N ii]/Hα emission line ratios. Based on this model, we demonstrate that the standard optical narrow emission line diagnostics used to identify massive black holes fail when the black hole mass falls below for highly accreting IMBHs and for radiatively inefficient IMBHs with active star formation. Our models call into question the ability of common optical spectroscopic diagnostics to confirm AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies, and indicate that the low-mass black hole occupation fraction inferred from such diagnostics will be severely biased.},

	abstract = {{Although the supermassive (AGN) and stellar mass (BHBs) black holes have many properties in common, the broad emission lines (BELs) are exclusively signatures of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on the detection of these lines from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data bases, there seems to be no AGN with mass MBH ≲ 105 M⊙. In this paper, we investigate if such low-mass black holes are really non-existent or they are undetected because the BELs in them are not produced efficiently. Using the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a wide range of black hole mass, 10--109 M⊙, spanning black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) to AGN, we calculate the equivalent widths (EWs) of ultraviolet and optical lines Lyα  1216 {\AA}, Hβ  4861 {\AA}, C iv 1549 {\AA} and Mg ii 2798 {\AA}. The LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model has been used to describe the broad emission-line region (BELR) for the calculations. We find that the hardening of the SED shape with decreasing mass do not decrease the BEL EWs. However, finite size of the BELR, as measured by the line widths, which is controlled by the mass of the black hole, regulates the production of these emission lines. There seems to be a peak in the EWs of the emission lines for typical AGN black holes of ∼108 M⊙, below which the lines become intrinsically fainter with a sharp fall-off below ∼106 M⊙. This may be the cause of the absence of low-mass AGN in SDSS.}},

	abstract = {We present a set of low-resolution empirical spectral energy distribution (SED) templates for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 μm to 30 μm based on the multi-wavelength photometric observations of the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey Bo{\"o}tes field and the spectroscopic observations of the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. Our training sample is comprised of 14,448 galaxies in the redshift range 0 ≲ z ≲ 1 and 5347 likely AGNs in the range 0 ≲ z ≲ 5.58. The galaxy templates correspond to the SED templates presented in 2008 by Assef et al. extended into the UV and mid-IR by the addition of FUV and NUV GALEX and MIPS 24 μm data for the field. We use our templates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and AGNs. While they are relatively accurate for galaxies (σz/(1 + z) = 0.04, with 5% outlier rejection), their accuracies for AGNs are a strong function of the luminosity ratio between the AGN and galaxy components. Somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the AGN and its host are well determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error. We also use our templates to study the mid-IR AGN selection criteria developed by Stern et al. in 2005 and Lacy et al. in 2004. We find that the Stern et al. criterion suffers from significant incompleteness when there is a strong host galaxy component and at z ≃ 4.5, when the broad Hα emission line is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated by low- and intermediate-redshift galaxies. The Lacy et al. criterion is not affected by incompleteness at z ≃ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by strong galaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Finally, we use our templates to predict the color--color distribution of sources in the upcoming Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission and define a color criterion to select AGNs analogous to those developed for IRAC photometry. We estimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 AGNs will be identified by these criteria, but without additional information, WISE-selected quasars will have serious completeness problems for z ≳ 3.4.},

	abstract = {We characterize infrared spectral energy distributions of 343 (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.3--2.8. We diagnose the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) by decomposing individual Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy into emission from star formation and an AGN-powered continuum; we classify sources as star-forming galaxies (SFGs), AGNs, or composites. Composites comprise 30% of our sample and are prevalent at faint and bright S24, making them an important source of IR AGN emission. We combine spectroscopy with multiwavelength photometry, including Herschel imaging, to create three libraries of publicly available templates (2--1000 μm). We fit the far-IR emission using a two-temperature modified blackbody to measure cold and warm dust temperatures (Tc and Tw). We find that Tc does not depend on mid-IR classification, while Tw shows a notable increase as the AGN grows more luminous. We measure a quadratic relationship between mid-IR AGN emission and total AGN contribution to LIR. AGNs, composites, and SFGs separate in S8/S3.6 and S250/S24, providing a useful diagnostic for estimating relative amounts of these sources. We estimate that >40% of IR-selected samples host an AGN, even at faint selection thresholds (S24 > 100 μJy). Our decomposition technique and color diagnostics are relevant given upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

We selected all optically detected SDSS sources with redshift measurements, combined additional broadband photometry from WISE, UKIDSS, 2MASS, and GALEX, and modeled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our sample sources. We parameterize nuclear obscuration in our SEDs with and uncover thousands of powerful obscured AGNs that lack X-ray counterparts, many of which are identified as AGN candidates based on straightforward WISE photometric criteria. Using the observed luminosity correlation between rest-frame 2--10 keV () and rest-frame AGN (), we estimate the intrinsic X-ray luminosities of our sample sources and combine these data with flux limits from X-ray catalogs to determine lower limits on nuclear obscuration. Using the ratio of intrinsic-to-observed X-ray luminosity (), we find a significant fraction of sources with column densities approaching  cm--2, suggesting that multiwavelength observations are necessary to account for the population of heavily obscured AGNs. We simulate the underlying distribution for the X-ray non-detected sources in our sample through survival analysis, and confirm the presence of AGN activity via X-ray stacking. Our results point to a considerable population of extremely obscured AGNs undetected by current X-ray observatories.},

	abstract = {We present a study of Spitzer/IRAC and X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) selection techniques in order to quantify the overlap, uniqueness, contamination, and completeness of each. We investigate how the overlap and possible contamination of the samples depend on the depth of both the IR and X-ray data. We use Spitzer/IRAC imaging, Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging, and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey to construct galaxy and AGN samples at 0.2 < z < 1.2 over 8 deg2. We construct samples over a wide range of IRAC flux limits (SWIRE to GOODS depth) and X-ray flux limits (10 ks to 2 Ms). We compare IR-AGN samples defined using both the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and Donley et al. with X-ray-detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and X-ray surveys, we find that ∼75% of IR-selected AGNs are also identified as X-ray AGNs. This fraction increases to ∼90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data, indicating that at most ∼10% of IR-selected AGNs may be heavily obscured. The IR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by star-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though the selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall, the IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGNs, while the X-ray AGN samples identify a wider range of AGN accretion rates including low specific accretion rate AGNs, where the host galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of the IR and X-ray AGN samples have similar rest-frame colors and stellar masses; both selections identify AGNs in blue, star-forming and red, quiescent galaxies.},
