@article{luo2015,
	abstract = {The Large sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) general survey is a spectroscopic survey that will eventually cover approximately half of the celestial sphere and collect 10 million spectra of stars, galaxies and QSOs. Objects in both the pilot survey and the first year regular survey are included in the LAMOST DR1. The pilot survey started in October 2011 and ended in June 2012, and the data have been released to the public as the LAMOST Pilot Data Release in August 2012. The regular survey started in September 2012, and completed its first year of operation in June 2013. The LAMOST DR1 includes a total of 1202 plates containing 2 955 336 spectra, of which 1 790 879 spectra have observed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 10. All data with SNR ≥ 2 are formally released as LAMOST DR1 under the LAMOST data policy. This data release contains a total of 2 204 696 spectra, of which 1 944 329 are stellar spectra, 12 082 are galaxy spectra and 5017 are quasars. The DR1 not only includes spectra, but also three stellar catalogs with measured parameters: late A,FGK-type stars with high quality spectra (1061 918 entries), A-type stars (100 073 entries), and M-type stars (121 522 entries). This paper introduces the survey design, the observational and instrumental limitations, data reduction and analysis, and some caveats. A description of the FITS structure of spectral files and parameter catalogs is also provided.},

	abstract = {Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 with KVega &lt; 22 from GOODS, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR to submillimeter, radio, and rest-frame UV wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z ~ 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8 μm &lt; 1011 L☉), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8 μm &gt; 1011 L☉, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 μm-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived (≳400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z &gt; 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

@article{rodighiero2011,
	abstract = {Two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies: a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formation rate (SFR)--stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such a sequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. Such starburst galaxies are rare but have much higher SFRs, and it is of interest to establish the relative importance of these two modes. PACS/Herschel observations over the whole COSMOS and GOODS-South fields, in conjunction with previous optical/near-IR data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first time the relative contribution of the two modes to the global SFR density in the redshift interval 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formation activity. The logarithmic distributions of galaxy SFRs at fixed stellar mass are well described by Gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only a relatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for SFRs more than four times higher than on the main sequence. Such starburst galaxies represent only 2% of mass-selected star-forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic SFR density at z ∼ 2. Only when limited to SFR &gt; 1000 M☉ yr−1, off-sequence sources significantly contribute to the SFR density (46% $\pm$ 20%). We conclude that merger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role in the formation of stars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase toward the quenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.},

@article{eales2018,
	abstract = {The galaxies found in optical surveys fall in two distinct regions of a diagram of optical colour versus absolute magnitude: the red sequence and the blue cloud, with the green valley in between. We show that the galaxies found in a submillimetre survey have almost the opposite distribution in this diagram, forming a `green mountain'. We show that these distinctive distributions follow naturally from a single, continuous, curved Galaxy Sequence in a diagram of specific star formation rate versus stellar mass, without there being the need for a separate star-forming galaxy main sequence and region of passive galaxies. The cause of the red sequence and the blue cloud is the geometric mapping between stellar mass/specific star formation rate and absolute magnitude/colour, which distorts a continuous Galaxy Sequence in the diagram of intrinsic properties into a bimodal distribution in the diagram of observed properties. The cause of the green mountain is Malmquist bias in the submillimetre waveband, with submillimetre surveys tending to select galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence, which have the highest ratios of submillimetre-to-optical luminosity. This effect, working in reverse, causes galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence to be underrepresented in optical samples, deepening the green valley. The green valley is therefore not evidence (1) for there being two distinct populations of galaxies, (2) for galaxies in this region evolving more quickly than galaxies in the blue cloud and the red sequence, and (3) for rapid-quenching processes in the galaxy population.},

	abstract = {We explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxy properties, clustering, and Eddington ratios of AGNs selected in the radio, X-ray, and infrared (IR) wavebands. We study a sample of 585 AGNs at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 using redshifts from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES). We select AGNs with observations in the radio at 1.4 GHz from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, X-rays from the Chandra XBo{\"o}tes Survey, and mid-IR from the Spitzer IRAC Shallow Survey. The radio, X-ray, and IR AGN samples show only modest overlap, indicating that to the flux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of AGNs. We derive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as Eddington ratios, for obscured or optically faint AGNs. We also measure the two-point cross-correlation between AGNs and galaxies on scales of 0.3--10 h−1 Mpc, and derive typical dark matter halo masses. We find that: (1) radio AGNs are mainly found in luminous red sequence galaxies, are strongly clustered (with Mhalo ∼ 3 × 1013 h−1 M☉), and have very low Eddington ratios λ ≲ 10−3; (2) X-ray-selected AGNs are preferentially found in galaxies that lie in the ``green valley'' of color--magnitude space and are clustered similar to the typical AGES galaxies (Mhalo ∼ 1013 h−1 M☉), with 10−3 ≲ λ ≲ 1; (3) IR AGNs reside in slightly bluer, slightly less luminous galaxies than X-ray AGNs, are weakly clustered (Mhalo ≲ 1012h−1 M☉), and have λ&gt;10−2. We interpret these results in terms of a simple model of AGN and galaxy evolution, whereby a ``quasar'' phase and the growth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches a critical mass between ∼1012 and 1013 M☉. After this event, star formation ceases and AGN accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and IR-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically faint, radio-bright) modes.},

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (Galfit, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'e}rsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

@article{budavari2000,
	abstract = {Understanding how the physical properties of galaxies (e.g., their spectral type or age) evolve as a function of redshift relies on having an accurate representation of galaxy spectral energy distributions. While it has been known for some time that galaxy spectra can be reconstructed from a handful of orthogonal basis templates, the underlying basis is poorly constrained. The limiting factor has been the lack of large samples of galaxies (covering a wide range in spectral type) with high signal-to-noise spectrophotometric observations. To alleviate this problem we introduce here a new technique for reconstructing galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from samples of galaxies with broadband photometric data and spectroscopic redshifts. Exploiting the statistical approach of the Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve expansion, our iterative training procedure increasingly improves the eigenbasis, so that it provides better agreement with the photometry. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying these improved spectral energy distributions to the estimation of photometric redshifts for the HDF sample of galaxies. We find that in a small number of iterations the dispersion in the photometric redshifts estimator (a comparison between predicted and measured redshifts) can decrease by up to a factor of 2.},

	abstract = {We study a new population of extremely red objects (EROs) recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) based on their NIRCam colors F277W − F444W &gt; 1.5 mag. We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W &lt; 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 &lt; z &lt; 7, with median . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short-wavelength colors (F150W − F200W ∼ 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty,  ∼ 10 and A  V  ≳ 3 mag, or low mass and obscured,  ∼ 7.5 and A  V  ∼ 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO). SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of AGNs. If any EROs are confirmed to have  ≳ 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z &gt; 7 by up to a factor ∼60. Similarly, if they are QSOs with luminosities in the L bol &gt; 1045--46 erg s−1 range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than three orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {{The sample of dwarf galaxies with measured central black hole masses M and velocity dispersions σ has recently doubled, and gives a close fit to the extrapolation of the M  - σ relation for more massive galaxies. We argue that this is difficult to reconcile with suggestions that the scaling relations between galaxies and their central black holes are simply a statistical consequence of assembly through repeated mergers. This predicts black hole masses significantly larger than those observed in dwarf galaxies unless the initial distribution of uncorrelated seed black hole and stellar masses is confined to much smaller masses than earlier assumed. It also predicts a noticeable flattening of the M  - σ relation for dwarfs, to M ∝ σ2 compared with the observed M ∝ σ4. In contrast black hole feedback predicts that black hole masses tend towards a universal M ∝ σ4 relation in all galaxies, and correctly gives the properties of powerful outflows recently observed in dwarf galaxies. These considerations emphasize once again that the fundamental physical black hole -- galaxy scaling relation is between M and σ. The relation of M to the bulge mass Mb is acausal, and depends on the quite independent connection between Mb and σ set by stellar feedback.}},

	abstract = {We assemble a sample of 733 dwarf galaxies (M * ≤ 109.5 M ⊙) with signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and explore the intersection between different AGN-selection techniques. Objects in our database are compiled from previous studies that identify AGN in dwarf galaxies through spectroscopy, X-ray emission, infrared colors, and optical photometric variability. We apply a uniform set of AGN diagnostic tools to the database using archival data. We find that any single selection method captures no more than half of the overall AGN population, and there is a general disagreement among the AGN-selection methods in this stellar-mass regime. The largest overlap between methods is found when both methods use optical spectroscopic data. In contrast, the populations of AGN intersect the least when comparing those methods that use photometric data at different wavelengths. These results can be used to better constrain the active fraction in dwarf galaxies, which is in turn an important constraint for black hole seed formation models. In a follow-up paper, we will explore links between the effectiveness of each selection technique and host galaxy properties.},

	abstract = {{The Merian survey is mapping ∼ 850 deg2 of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program (HSC-SSP) wide layer with two medium-band filters on the 4-m Victor M. Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, with the goal of carrying the first high signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of weak gravitational lensing around dwarf galaxies. This paper presents the design of the Merian filter set: N708 (λc = 7080 {\AA}, Δλ = 275 {\AA}) and N540 (λc = 5400 {\AA}, Δλ = 210 {\AA}). The central wavelengths and filter widths of N708 and N540 were designed to detect the \\$\\rm H\\alpha\\$ and \\$\\rm [OIII]\\$ emission lines of galaxies in the mass range \\$8\\lt \\rm \\log M\_*/M\_\\odot \\lt 9\\$ by comparing Merian fluxes with HSC broad-band fluxes. Our filter design takes into account the weak lensing S/N and photometric redshift performance. Our simulations predict that Merian will yield a sample of ∼ 85 000 star-forming dwarf galaxies with a photometric redshift accuracy of σΔz/(1 + z) ∼ 0.01 and an outlier fraction of \\$\\eta =2.8~\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ over the redshift range 0.058 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 0.10. With 60 full nights on the Blanco/Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Merian survey is predicted to measure the average weak lensing profile around dwarf galaxies with lensing S/N ∼32 within r \\&lt; 0.5 Mpc and lensing S/N ∼90 within r \\&lt; 1.0 Mpc. This unprecedented sample of star-forming dwarf galaxies will allow for studies of the interplay between dark matter and stellar feedback and their roles in the evolution of dwarf galaxies.}},

	abstract = {We present an X-ray analysis of 14 nearby (z &lt; 0.044) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass galaxies (M * ≲ 5 × 109 M ⊙) selected based on their optical variability. Comparing and contrasting different AGN selection techniques in low-mass galaxies is essential for obtaining an accurate estimate of the active fraction in this regime. We use both new and archival observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to search for X-ray point sources consistent with AGNs. Four objects have detected nuclear X-ray emission with luminosities ranging from L 0.5−7 ≈ 3 × 1040 to 9 × 1042 erg s−1 with two more marginal detections. All of the detected galaxies have luminosities exceeding those anticipated from X-ray binaries, and all sources are nuclear, suggesting the X-ray emission in most sources is due to an AGN. These observations demonstrate the success of variability at identifying AGNs in low-mass galaxies. We also explore emission-line diagnostics and discuss the differences in the results of these methods for AGN selection, in particular regarding low-mass and low-metallicity systems.},

	abstract = {{The validity of the unified active galactic nuclei (AGNs) model has been challenged in the last decade, especially when different types of AGNs are considered to only differ in the viewing angle to the torus. We aim to assess the importance of the viewing angle in classifying different types of Seyfert galaxies in spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling. We retrieve photometric data from publicly available astronomical data bases: CDS and NED, to model SEDs with x-cigale in a sample of 13 173 Seyfert galaxies located at redshift range from z = 0 to 3.5, with a median redshift of z ≈ 0.2. We assess whether the estimated viewing angle from the SED models reflects different Seyfert classifications. Two AGN models with either a smooth or clumpy torus structure are adopted in this paper. We find that the viewing angle in Type-1 AGNs is better constrained than in Type-2 AGNs. Limiting the viewing angles representing these two types of AGNs does not affect the physical parameter estimates such as star formation rate (SFR) or AGN fractional contribution (fAGN). In addition, the viewing angle is not the most discriminating physical parameter to differentiate Seyfert types. We suggest that the observed and intrinsic AGN disc luminosity can (i) be used in z \\&lt; 0.5 studies to distinguish between Type-1 and Type-2 AGNs, and (ii) explain the probable evolutionary path between these AGN types. Finally, we propose the use of x-cigale for AGN galaxy classification tasks. All data from the 13 173 SED fits are available at Zenodo1.}},

@article{shen2020,
	abstract = {{In this paper, we provide updated constraints on the bolometric quasar luminosity function (QLF) from z = 0 to z = 7. The constraints are based on an observational compilation that includes observations in the rest-frame IR, B band, UV, soft, and hard X-ray in past decades. Our method follows Hopkins et al. with an updated quasar SED model and bolometric and extinction corrections. The new best-fitting bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves qualitatively different from the old Hopkins model at high redshift. Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at z ≳ 2. Due to the paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at z ≳ 5 is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow faint-end slope at z ≳ 5. Further multiband observations of the faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH mass density, and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only becomes important at z ≲ 3. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH mass density, and SMBH mass function are generally consistent with existing observations.}},

	abstract = {{We examine the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes in the simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. simba grows black holes via gravitational torque-limited accretion from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, while feedback from black holes is modelled in radiative and jet modes depending on the Eddington ratio (fEdd). simba shows generally good agreement with local studies of black hole properties, such as the black hole mass--stellar velocity dispersion (MBH--σ) relation, the black hole accretion rate versus star formation rate (BHAR--SFR), and the black hole mass function. MBH--σ evolves such that galaxies at a given MBH have higher σ at higher redshift, consistent with no evolution in MBH--M⋆. For \\$M\_\\{\\rm BH\\}\\lesssim 10^8\\, \\{\\rm M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$, fEdd is anticorrelated with MBH since the BHAR is approximately independent of MBH, while at higher masses fEdd--MBH flattens and has a larger scatter. BHAR versus SFR is invariant with redshift, but fEdd drops steadily with time at a given MBH, such that all but the most massive black holes are accreting in a radiatively efficient mode at \\$z\\gtrsim 2\\$. The black hole mass function amplitude decreases with redshift and is locally dominated by quiescent galaxies for MBH \\&gt; 108 M⊙, but for \\$z\\gtrsim 1\\$ star-forming galaxies dominate at all MBH. The z = 0 fEdd distribution is roughly lognormal with a peak at \\$f\_\\{\\rm Edd\\}\\lesssim 0.01\\$ as observed, shifting to higher fEdd at higher redshifts. Finally, we study the dependence of black hole properties with H i content and find that the correlation between gas content and SFR is modulated by black hole properties, such that higher SFR galaxies at a given gas content have smaller black holes with higher fEdd.}},

	abstract = {We present the public data release of halo and galaxy catalogues extracted from the eagle suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. These simulations were performed with an enhanced version of the gadget code that includes a modified hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter and subgrid treatments of baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss, element-by-element radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star formation and black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs performed in volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the gas at the star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid models for feedback are calibrated to the redshift z=0 galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes and black hole mass--stellar mass relation. The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations for present-day and higher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees. The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational database which we are making available for general use. A large number of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than 105 galaxies, examples of which are provided in the Appendix. The relatively good and broad agreement of the simulations with a wide range of observational datasets makes the database an ideal resource for the analysis of model galaxies through time, and for connecting and interpreting observational datasets.},

	abstract = {{We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard Λ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲ 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 \\&lt; M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully--Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C iv and O vi. While the mass--metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.}},

	abstract = {{We present results from 13 cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the `Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy
stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation -- the EAGLE reference model -- by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass ≲ M⋆ (the `knee' of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.}},

	abstract = {{The interplay between cosmic gas accretion on to galaxies and galaxy mergers drives the observed morphological diversity of galaxies. By comparing the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Horizon-AGN and Horizon-noAGN, we unambiguously identify the critical role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in setting up the correct galaxy morphology for the massive end of the population. With AGN feedback, typical kinematic and morpho-metric properties of galaxy populations as well as the galaxy--halo mass relation are in much better agreement with observations. Only AGN feedback allows massive galaxies at the centre of groups and clusters to become ellipticals, while without AGN feedback those galaxies reform discs. It is the merger-enhanced AGN activity that is able to freeze the morphological type of the post-merger remnant by durably quenching its quiescent star formation. Hence morphology is shown to be driven not only by mass but also by the nature of cosmic accretion: at constant galaxy mass, ellipticals are galaxies that are mainly assembled through mergers, while discs are preferentially built from the in situ star formation fed by smooth cosmic gas infall.}},

The analysis of more than 150 000 galaxies per time step in the redshift range 1.2 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 1.8 with morphological diversity shows that the spin of low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouring filaments, while high-mass red galaxies tend to have a perpendicular spin. The reorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers, which are significant in their mass build-up. We find that the stellar mass transition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3 × 1010舁M⊙. Galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migrate towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular momentum into spin. The signature of this process can be traced to the properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a strong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quench in situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. It allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and, therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.}},

	abstract = {{Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ∼ 10 h Mpc−1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z ≃ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109--1010 h−2 M⊙. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope γ is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from γ ∼ 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to γ ∼ 1.6 at redshift z ∼ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around ∼ 5 per cent.}},

Investigating the build-up of the colour--mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale Δtgreen is ∼1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence.

We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M⋆/M⊙) ∼ 9.7--11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star--neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z ≈ 2--4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.}},

	abstract = {{We present an overview of galaxy evolution across cosmic time in the Illustris simulation. Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2 × 18203 resolution elements in a (106.5 Mpc)3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z = 0 using the arepo moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.}},

	abstract = {{We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5舁Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 106舁M⊙, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 × 106舁M⊙. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710舁pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48舁pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 × 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40舁000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully--Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.}},

	abstract = {We present the full public release of all data from the Illustris simulation project. Illustris is a suite of large volume, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo and including a comprehensive set of physical models critical for following the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Each simulates a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3 and self-consistently evolves five different types of resolution elements from a starting redshift of z=127 to the present day, z=0. These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run. These include three resolution levels with the fiducial ``full'' baryonic physics model, and a dark matter only analog for each. In addition, we provide four distinct, high time resolution, smaller volume ``subboxes''. The total data volume is ∼265 TB, including ∼800 full volume snapshots and ∼30,000 subbox snapshots. We describe the released data products as well as tools we have developed for their analysis. All data may be directly downloaded in its native HDF5 format. Additionally, we release a comprehensive, web-based API which allows programmatic access to search and data processing tasks. In both cases we provide example scripts and a getting-started guide in several languages: currently, IDL, Python, and Matlab. This paper addresses scientific issues relevant for the interpretation of the simulations, serves as a pointer to published and on-line documentation of the project, describes planned future additional data releases, and discusses technical aspects of the release.},

	abstract = {{The past decade has seen significant progress in understanding galaxy formation and evolution using large-scale cosmological simulations. While these simulations produce galaxies in overall good agreement with observations, they employ different sub-grid models for galaxies and supermassive black holes (BHs). We investigate the impact of the sub-grid models on the BH mass properties of the Illustris, TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations, focusing on the MBH − M⋆ relation and the BH mass function. All simulations predict tight MBH − M⋆ relations, and struggle to produce BHs of \\$M\_\\{\\rm BH\\}\\leqslant 10^\\{7.5\\}\\, \\rm M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$ in galaxies of \\$M\_\\{\\star \\}\\sim 10^\\{10.5\\}\\!-\\!10^\\{11.5\\}\\, \\rm M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$. While the time evolution of the mean MBH − M⋆ relation is mild (\\$\\rm \\Delta M\_\\{\\rm BH\\}\\leqslant 1\\, dex\\$ for 0 \\$\\leqslant z \\leqslant\\$ 5) for all the simulations, its linearity (shape) and normalization varies from simulation to simulation. The strength of SN feedback has a large impact on the linearity and time evolution for \\$M\_\\{\\star \\}\\leqslant 10^\\{10.5\\}\\, \\rm M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$. We find that the low-mass end is a good discriminant of the simulation models, and highlights the need for new observational constraints. At the high-mass end, strong AGN feedback can suppress the time evolution of the relation normalization. Compared with observations of the local Universe, we find an excess of BHs with \\$M\_\\{\\rm BH\\}\\geqslant 10^\\{9\\}\\, \\rm M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$ in most of the simulations. The BH mass function is dominated by efficiently accreting BHs (\\$\\log \_\\{10\\}\\, f\_\\{\\rm Edd\\}\\geqslant -2\\$) at high redshifts, and transitions progressively from the high-mass to the low-mass end to be governed by inactive BHs. The transition time and the contribution of active BHs are different among the simulations, and can be used to evaluate models against observations.}},

@article{dubois2012,
	abstract = {{We develop a subgrid model for the growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) and their associated active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. This model transposes previous attempts to describe BH accretion and AGN feedback with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique to the adaptive mesh refinement framework. It also furthers their development by implementing a new jet-like outflow treatment of the AGN feedback which we combine with the heating mode traditionally used in the SPH approach. Thus, our approach allows one to test the robustness of the conclusions derived from simulating the impact of self-regulated AGN feedback on galaxy formation vis-{\`a}-vis the numerical method. Assuming that BHs are created in the early stages of galaxy formation, they grow by mergers and accretion of gas at a Eddington-limited Bondi accretion rate. However this growth is regulated by AGN feedback which we model using two different modes: a quasar-heating mode when accretion rates on to the BHs are comparable to the Eddington rate, and a radio-jet mode at lower accretion rates which not only deposits energy, but also deposits mass and momentum on the grid. In other words, our feedback model deposits energy as a succession of thermal bursts and jet outflows depending on the properties of the gas surrounding the BHs. We assess the plausibility of such a model by comparing our results to observational measurements of the co-evolution of BHs and their host galaxy properties, and check their robustness with respect to numerical resolution. We show that AGN feedback must be a crucial physical ingredient for the formation of massive galaxies as it appears to be able to efficiently prevent the accumulation of and/or expel cold gas out of haloes/galaxies and significantly suppress star formation. Our model predicts that the relationship between BHs and their host galaxy mass evolves as a function of redshift, because of the vigorous accretion of cold material in the early Universe that drives Eddington-limited accretion on to BHs. Quasar activity is also enhanced at high redshift. However, as structures grow in mass and lose their cold material through star formation and efficient BH feedback ejection, the AGN activity in the low-redshift Universe becomes more and more dominated by the radio mode, which powers jets through the hot circumgalactic medium.}},

	abstract = {{We analyse the demographics of black holes (BHs) in the large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. This simulation statistically models how much gas is accreted on to BHs, traces the energy deposited into their environment and, consequently, the back-reaction of the ambient medium on BH growth. The synthetic BHs reproduce a variety of observational constraints such as the redshift evolution of the BH mass density and the mass function. Strong self-regulation via AGN feedback, weak supernova feedback, and unresolved internal processes result in a tight BH--galaxy mass correlation. Starting at z ∼ 2, tidal stripping creates a small population of BHs over-massive with respect to the halo. The fraction of galaxies hosting a central BH or an AGN increases with stellar mass. The AGN fraction agrees better with multi-wavelength studies, than single-wavelength ones, unless obscuration is taken into account. The most massive haloes present BH multiplicity, with additional BHs gained by ongoing or past mergers. In some cases, both a central and an off-centre AGN shine concurrently, producing a dual AGN. This dual AGN population dwindles with decreasing redshift, as found in observations. Specific accretion rate and Eddington ratio distributions are in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH population is dominated in turn by fast, slow, and very slow accretors, with transitions occurring at z = 3 and z = 2, respectively.}},

	abstract = {We consider the physical conditions under which supermassive black holes could have formed inside the first galaxies. Our smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations indicate that metal-free galaxies with a virial temperature of ~104 K and suppressed H2 formation (due to an intergalactic UV background) tend to form a binary black hole system that contains a substantial fraction (≳10%) of the total baryonic mass of the host galaxy. Fragmentation into stars is suppressed without substantial H2 cooling. Our simulations follow the condensation of ~5 × 106 M☉ around the two centers of the binary down to a scale of ≲0.1 pc. Low-spin galaxies form a single black hole instead. These early black holes lead to quasar activity before the epoch of reionization. Primordial black hole binaries lead to gravitational radiation emission at redshifts z ≳ 10 that would be detectable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.},

@article{koushiappas2004,
	abstract = {{We present a cosmologically motivated model in which the seeds of supermassive black holes form out of the lowest angular momentum gas in protogalaxies at high redshift. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, this leads naturally to a correlation between black hole masses and spheroid properties, as observed today. We assume that the gas in early‐forming, rare‐peak haloes has a distribution of specific angular momentum similar to that derived for the dark matter in cosmological N‐body simulations. This distribution has a significant low angular momentum tail, which implies that every protogalaxy should contain gas that ends up in a high‐density disc. In haloes more massive than a critical threshold of ∼7 × 107 M⊙ at z∼ 15, the discs are gravitationally unstable, and experience an efficient Lin--Pringle viscosity that transfers angular momentum outwards and allows mass inflow. We assume that this process continues until the first massive stars disrupt the disc. The seed black holes created in this manner have a characteristic mass of ∼105 M⊙, roughly independent of the redshift of formation. This serves as a lower bound for black hole masses at galactic centres today. The comoving mass density in black hole seeds grows with time, tracking the continuous production of critical‐mass haloes, and saturates when cosmic reionization acts to prevent gas cooling in these low‐mass systems. By z∼ 15, the comoving mass density becomes comparable to that inferred from observations, with room for appropriate additional luminous growth during a later quasar accretion phase. The hierarchical merger process after z∼ 15 naturally leads to a linear correlation between black hole mass and stellar spheroid mass, with negligible black hole masses in disc‐dominated galaxies. The formation of massive seeds at high redshifts, and the relatively important role of mergers in the buildup of today's black holes, are key elements in the proposed scenario.}},

	abstract = {We present the results of a systematic, broadband X-ray spectral analysis of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with the X-ray clumpy torus model (XCLUMPY). By adding 16 AGNs newly analyzed in this paper, we study a total of 28 AGNs, including unabsorbed and absorbed AGNs taken from Ichikawa et al. and Garc{\'\i}a-Bernete et al. This is the largest sample whose X-ray and infrared spectra are analyzed by the clumpy torus models XCLUMPY and CLUMPY, respectively. The relation between the Eddington ratio and the torus covering factor determined from the X-ray torus parameters of each object follows the trend found by Ricci et al. based on a statistical analysis. We confirm the results by Tanimoto et al. that (1) the torus angular widths determined by the infrared data are larger than those by the X-ray data and (2) the ratios of hydrogen column density to V-band extinction (NH/AV) along the line of sight in obscured AGNs are similar to the Galactic value, on average. Unobscured AGNs show apparently smaller line-of-sight NH/AV ratios than the Galactic one. Our findings can be well explained by an updated unified picture of AGN structure including a dusty torus, dusty polar outflows, and dust-free gas, where the inclination determines the X-ray and optical classifications and observed torus properties in the X-ray and infrared bands.},

	abstract = {According to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the central engine is surrounded by dusty, optically thick clouds in a toroidal structure. We have recently developed a formalism that for the first time takes proper account of the clumpy nature of the AGN torus. We now provide a detailed report of our findings in a two-paper series. Here we present our general formalism for radiative transfer in clumpy media and construct its building blocks for the AGN problem---the source functions of individual dusty clouds heated by the AGN radiation field. We show that a fundamental difference from smooth density distributions is that in a clumpy medium, a large range of dust temperatures coexist at the same distance from the radiation central source. This distinct property explains the low dust temperatures found close to the nucleus of NGC 1068 in 10 μ m  interferometric observations. We find that, irrespective of the overall geometry, a clumpy dust distribution shows only moderate variation in its spectral energy distribution, and the 10 μ m  absorption feature is never deep. Furthermore, the X-ray attenuating column density is widely scattered around the column density that characterizes the IR emission. All of these properties are characteristic of AGN observations. The assembly of clouds into AGN tori and comparison with observations are presented in the companion paper.},

	abstract = {The population of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies is elusive, but fundamentally important to understand the coevolution of black holes with their hosts and the formation of the first collapsed objects in the universe. While some progress was made in determining the X-ray detected fraction of MBHs in dwarfs, with typical values ranging from 0%--6%, their overall active fraction, , is still largely unconstrained. Here, we develop a theoretical model to predict the multiwavelength active fraction of MBHs in dwarf galaxies starting from first principles and based on the physical properties of the host, namely, its stellar mass and angular momentum content. We find multiwavelength active fractions for MBHs, accreting at typically low rates, ranging from 5%--22%, and increasing with the stellar mass of the host as   . If dwarfs are characterized by low-metallicity environments, the active fraction may reach ∼30% for the most massive hosts. For galaxies with stellar mass in the range of 107 &lt; M ⋆[ M ⊙] &lt; 1010, our predictions are in agreement with occupation fractions derived from simulations and semi-analytical models. Additionally, we provide a fitting formula to predict the probability of finding an active MBH in a dwarf galaxy from observationally derived data. This model will be instrumental to guide future observational efforts to find MBHs in dwarfs. The James Webb Space Telescope, in particular, will play a crucial role in detecting MBHs in dwarfs, possibly uncovering active fractions ∼3 times larger than current X-ray surveys.},

@article{haehnelt1993,
	abstract = {{A model to explain the evolution of the quasar luminosity function is presented. At intermediate and high redshifts, the formation of `new' black holes at each step in the hierarchical growth of structure is invoked as the driving force of the strong evolution of the quasar population. Quasars are assumed to be short-lived, constituting the first phase of the formation of a galaxy in the potential well of a dark matter halo. The timelag between halo virialization and the birth of the quasar is expected to be short compared to the cosmological time-scale, even at high redshifts. Simple assumptions are made to relate the luminosity of a quasar to the mass of its central black hole and to the mass of its corresponding host object. The Press-Schechter formalism is used within the CDM scenario (q0 = 0.5, h100 = 0.5) to estimate the number of newly forming dark matter haloes at successive cosmic epochs. A rapid rise in the number density of newly forming massive black holes is followed by a steep fall; this can explain the observed dependence of the quasar population on redshift. Model luminosity functions are calculated and found to be in good agreement with the observational data. By assuming that slingshot ejection is unimportant, a mass function of remnant black holes is calculated. Remnant black holes are predicted for virtually all galaxies, but would be less massive in late-forming galaxies and in galaxies with shallower potential wells.}},

@article{butler2011,
	abstract = {We present a novel method for the optimal selection of quasars using time-series observations in a single photometric bandpass. Utilizing the damped random walk model of Kelly et al., we parameterize the ensemble quasar structure function in Sloan Stripe 82 as a function of observed brightness. The ensemble model fit can then be evaluated rigorously for and calibrated with individual light curves with no parameter fitting. This yields a classification in two statistics---one describing the fit confidence and the other describing the probability of a false alarm---which can be tuned, a priori, to achieve high quasar detection fractions (99% completeness with default cuts), given an acceptable rate of false alarms. We establish the typical rate of false alarms due to known variable stars as ≲3% (high purity). Applying the classification, we increase the sample of potential quasars relative to those known in Stripe 82 by as much as 29%, and by nearly a factor of two in the redshift range 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3, where selection by color is extremely inefficient. This represents 1875 new quasars in a 290 deg2 field. The observed rates of both quasars and stars agree well with the model predictions, with &gt;99% of quasars exhibiting the expected variability profile. We discuss the utility of the method at high redshift and in the regime of noisy and sparse data. Our time-series selection complements well-independent selection based on quasar colors and has strong potential for identifying high-redshift quasars for Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and other cosmology studies in the LSST era.},

	abstract = {{Some galaxies show little to no sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, yet exhibit strong coronal emission lines (CLs) relative to common narrow emission lines. Many of these CLs have ionization potentials of ≥100 eV, thus requiring strong extreme UV and/or soft X-ray flux. It has long been thought that such events are powered by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but owing to a lack of detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, such a connection has not been firmly made. Here we compare coronal line emitters (CLEs) and TDEs in terms of their host-galaxy and transient properties. We find that the mid-infrared (MIR) colors of CLE hosts in quiescence are similar to TDE hosts. Additionally, many CLEs show evidence of a large dust reprocessing echo in their mid-infrared colors, a sign of significant dust in the nucleus. The stellar masses and star formation rates of the CLE hosts are largely consistent with TDE hosts, with many CLEs residing within the green valley. The blackbody properties of CLEs and TDEs are similar, with some CLEs showing hot (T ≥40, 000 K) blackbody temperatures. Finally, the location of CLEs on the peak-luminosity/decline-rate parameter space is much closer to TDEs than many other major classes of nuclear transients. Combined, these provide strong evidence to confirm the previous claims that CLEs are indeed TDEs in gas-rich environments. We additionally propose a stricter threshold of CL flux ≥1/3 × [O iii] flux to better exclude AGNs from the sample of CLEs.}},

	abstract = {{Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [N ii] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [S ii] and [O i] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [N ii] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2--3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ∼23 000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ∼40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.}},

@article{gallo2010,
	abstract = {We complete the census of nuclear X-ray activity in 100 early-type Virgo galaxies observed by the Chandra X-ray Telescope as part of the AMUSE-Virgo survey, down to a (3σ) limiting luminosity of 3.7 × 1038 erg s−1 over 0.5--7 keV. The stellar mass distribution of the targeted sample, which is mostly composed of formally ``inactive'' galaxies, peaks below 1010 M☉, a regime where the very existence of nuclear supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is debated. Out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear X-ray source, including 6 hybrid nuclei which also host a massive nuclear cluster as visible from archival Hubble Space Telescope images. After carefully accounting for contamination from nuclear low-mass X-ray binaries based on the shape and normalization of their X-ray luminosity function (XLF), we conclude that between 24% and 34% of the galaxies in our sample host an X-ray active SMBH (at the 95% confidence level). This sets a firm lower limit to the black hole (BH) occupation fraction in nearby bulges within a cluster environment. The differential logarithmic XLF of active SMBHs scales with the X-ray luminosity as LX−0.4$\pm$0.1 up to 1042 erg s−1. At face value, the active fraction---down to our luminosity limit---is found to increase with host stellar mass. However, taking into account selection effects, we find that the average Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity scales with BH mass as MBH, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.46+0.08−0.06 dex. This finding can be interpreted as observational evidence for ``down-sizing'' of BH accretion in local early types, that is, low-mass BHs shine relatively closer to their Eddington limit than higher mass objects. As a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, defined as those above a fixed X-ray Eddington ratio, decreases with increasing BH mass.},

	abstract = {{We present an analysis of Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)/Hubble Space Telescope optical spectra of a sample of 10 Seyfert galaxies aimed at studying the structure and physical properties of the coronal-line region (CLR). The high spatial resolution provided by STIS allowed us to resolve the CLR and obtain key information about the kinematics of the CL gas, measure directly its spatial scale, and study the mechanisms that drive the high-ionization lines. We find CLRs extending from just a few parsecs ( pc) up to 230 pc in radius, consistent with the bulk of the coronal lines (CLs) originating between the broad-line region and narrow-line region (NLR), and extending into the NLR in the case of [Fe vii] and [Ne v] lines. The CL profiles strongly vary with the distance to the nucleus. We observed line splitting in the core of some of the galaxies. Line peak shifts, both redshift and blueshift, typically reached 500 km s−1, and even higher velocities (1000 km s−1) in some of the galaxies. In general, CLs follow the same pattern of rotation curves as low-ionization lines like [O iii]. From a direct comparison between the radio and the CL emission we find that neither the strength nor the kinematics of the CLs scales in any obvious and strong way with the radio jets. Moreover, the similarity of the flux distributions and kinematics of the CLs and low-ionization lines, the low temperatures derived for the gas, and the success of photoionization models to reproduce, within a factor of a few, the observed line ratios, point towards photoionization as the main driving mechanism of CLs.}},

	abstract = {We conduct the first systematic survey of a comprehensive set of the twenty optical coronal lines in the spectra of nearly 1 million galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 catalog. This includes often overlooked high ionization potential lines such as [Ar x] λ5533, [S xii] λ7609, [Fe xi] λ7892, and [Fe xiv] λ5303. We find that, given the limited sensitivity of SDSS, strong coronal line emission is extremely rare, with only ∼0.03% of the sample showing at least one coronal line, significantly lower than the fraction of galaxies showing optical narrow line ratios (∼17%) or mid-infrared colors (∼2%) indicative of nuclear activity. The coronal line luminosities exhibit a large dynamic range, with values ranging from ∼1034 to 1042 erg s−1. We find that a vast majority (∼80%) of coronal line emitters in dwarf galaxies (M * &lt; 9.6 × 109  M ⊙) do not display optical narrow line ratios indicative of nuclear activity, in contrast to higher mass galaxies (∼17%). Moreover, we find that the highest ionization potential lines are preferentially found in lower mass galaxies. These findings are consistent with the theory that lower mass black holes found in lower mass galaxies produce a hotter accretion disk, which in turn enhances the higher ionization coronal line spectrum. Future coronal line searches with 30 m class telescopes or JWST may provide a pathway into uncovering the intermediate mass black hole population.},

	abstract = {We report the detection of coherent pulsations from the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 7793 P13. The ≈0.42 s nearly sinusoidal pulsations were initially discovered in broadband X-ray observations using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR taken in 2016. We subsequently also found pulsations in archival XMM-Newton data taken in 2013 and 2014. The significant (≫5σ) detection of coherent pulsations demonstrates that the compact object in P13 is a neutron star, and given the observed peak luminosity of ≈1040  (assuming isotropy), it is well above the Eddington limit for a 1.4  accretor. This makes P13 the second ULX known to be powered by an accreting neutron star. The pulse period varies between epochs, with a slow but persistent spin-up over the 2013--2016 period. This spin-up indicates a magnetic field of B ≈1.5 ×1012 G, typical of many Galactic accreting pulsars. The most likely explanation for the extreme luminosity is a high degree of beaming; however, this is difficult to reconcile with the sinusoidal pulse profile.},

The outburst reached a peak luminosity of 3.4 × 1039 erg s−1 and lasted for about eight months, after which the source went below a luminosity of 1037 erg s−1; previous Chandra observations constrain the low-state luminosity below ∼2 × 1036 erg s−1, implying a variability of at least a factor 1000.

	abstract = {The ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) source ESO 243--49 HLX-1, which reaches a maximum luminosity of 1042 erg s−1 (0.2--10 keV), currently provides the strongest evidence for the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To study the spectral variability of the source, we conduct an ongoing monitoring campaign with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT), which now spans more than two years. We found that HLX-1 showed two fast rise and exponential decay type outbursts in the Swift XRT light curve with increases in the count rate of a factor ∼40 separated by 375 $\pm$ 13 days. We obtained new XMM-Newton and Chandra dedicated pointings that were triggered at the lowest and highest luminosities, respectively. From spectral fitting, the unabsorbed luminosities ranged from 1.9 × 1040 to 1.25 × 1042 erg s−1. We confirm here the detection of spectral state transitions from HLX-1 reminiscent of Galactic black hole binaries (GBHBs): at high luminosities, the X-ray spectrum showed a thermal state dominated by a disk component with temperatures of 0.26 keV at most, and at low luminosities the spectrum is dominated by a hard power law with a photon index in the range 1.4--2.1, consistent with a hard state. The source was also observed in a state consistent with the steep power-law state, with a photon index of ∼3.5. In the thermal state, the luminosity of the disk component appears to scale with the fourth power of the inner disk temperature, which supports the presence of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. The low fractional variability (rms of 9% $\pm$ 9%) in this state also suggests the presence of a dominant disk. The spectral changes and long-term variability of the source cannot be explained by variations of the beaming angle and are not consistent with the source being in a super-Eddington accretion state as is proposed for most ULX sources with lower luminosities. All this indicates that HLX-1 is an unusual ULX as it is similar to GBHBs, which have non-beamed and sub-Eddington emission, but with luminosities three orders of magnitude higher. In this picture, a lower limit on the mass of the black hole of &gt;9000 M☉ can be derived, and the relatively low disk temperature in the thermal state also suggests the presence of an IMBH of a few 103 M☉.},

We report the discovery of a radio nebula associated with the ULX IC 342 X-1 using the Very Large Array (VLA). Complementary VLA observations of the nebula around Holmberg II X-1, and high-frequency Australia Telescope Compact Array and Very Large Telescope spectroscopic observations of NGC 5408 X-1 are also presented. We study the morphology, ionization processes, and the energetics of the optical/radio nebulae of IC 342 X-1, Holmberg II X-1, and NGC 5408 X-1. The energetics of the optical nebula of IC 342 X-1 is discussed in the framework of standard bubble theory. The total energy content of the optical nebula is 6 × 1052 erg. The minimum energy needed to supply the associated radio nebula is 9.2 × 1050 erg. In addition, we detected an unresolved radio source at the location of IC 342 X-1 at the VLA scales. However, our Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations using the European VLBI Network likely rule out the presence of any compact radio source at milliarcsecond (mas) scales. Using a simultaneous Swift X-ray Telescope measurement, we estimate an upper limit on the mass of the black hole in IC 342 X-1 using the ``fundamental plane'' of accreting black holes and obtain MBH ⩽ (1.0 $\pm$ 0.3) × 103 M☉. Arguing that the nebula of IC 342 X-1 is possibly inflated by a jet, we estimate accretion rates and efficiencies for the jet of IC 342 X-1 and compare with sources like S26, SS433, and IC 10 X-1.},

	abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are promising test beds for constraining models of supermassive and intermediate-mass black holes (MBHs) via their BH occupation fraction (BHOF). Disentangling seeding from the confounding effects of mass assembly over a Hubble time is a challenging problem that we tackle in this study with a suite of semianalytical models (SAMs). We show how the measured BHOF depends on the lowest BH mass or active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity achieved by a survey. To tell seeding models apart, we need to detect or model all AGNs brighter than 1037 erg s−1 in galaxies of M * ∼ 108−10  M ⊙. Shallower surveys, like eRASS, cannot distinguish between seed models even with the compensation of a much larger survey volume. We show that the AMUSE survey, with its inference of the MBH population underlying the observed AGNs, strongly favors heavy seed models, growing with either a power-law Eddington ratio distribution function or one in which BH accretion is tied to the star formation rate (i.e., the AGN-main sequence, AGN-MS, model). These two growth channels can then be distinguished by the AGN luminosity function at &gt;1040 erg s−1, with the AGN-MS model requiring more accretion than observed at z ∼ 0. Thus, current X-ray observations favor heavy seeds whose Eddington ratios follow a power-law distribution. The different models also predict different radio scaling relations, which we quantify using the fundamental plane of BH activity. We close with recommendations for the design of upcoming multiwavelength campaigns that can optimally detect MBHs in dwarf galaxies.},

	abstract = {{Owing to their quiet evolutionary histories, nearby dwarf galaxies (stellar masses \\$M\_\\star \\lesssim 3 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot\\$) have the potential to teach us about the mechanism(s) that `seeded' the growth of supermassive black holes, and also how the first stellar mass black holes formed and interacted with their environments. Here, we present high spatial resolution observations of three dwarf galaxies in the X-ray (Chandra), the optical/near-infrared (Hubble Space Telescope), and the radio (Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array). These three galaxies were previously identified as hosting candidate active galactic nuclei on the basis of lower resolution X-ray imaging. With our new observations, we find that X-ray sources in two galaxies (SDSS J121326.01+543631.6 and SDSS J122111.29+173819.1) are off-nuclear and lack corresponding radio emission, implying they are likely luminous X-ray binaries. The third galaxy (Mrk 1434) contains two X-ray sources (each with LX ≈ 1040 erg s−1) separated by 2.8 arcsec, has a low metallicity [12 + log(O/H)  = 7.8], and emits nebular He ii λ4686 line emission. The northern source has spatially coincident point-like radio emission at 9.0 GHz and extended radio emission at 5.5 GHz. We discuss X-ray binary interpretations (where an ultraluminous X-ray source blows a `radio bubble') and active galactic nucleus interpretations (where an \\$\\approx 4\\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot\\$ black hole launches a jet). In either case, we find that the He ii emission cannot be photoionized by the X-ray source, unless the source was ≈30--90 times more luminous several hundred years ago.}},

	abstract = {{We study the emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM) in a sample of nearby late-type galaxies defined in Paper I. Our sample covers a broad range of star formation rates (SFRs) from ∼0.1 to ∼17 M⊙ yr−1 and stellar masses from ∼3 × 108 to ∼6 × 1010 M⊙. We take special care of systematic effects and contamination from bright and faint compact sources. We find that in all galaxies at least one optically thin thermal emission component is present in the unresolved emission, with the average temperature of 〈kT〉 = 0.24 keV. In about ∼1/3 of galaxies, a second, higher temperature component is required, with 〈kT〉 = 0.71 keV. Although statistically significant variations in temperature between galaxies are present, we do not find any meaningful trends with the stellar mass or SFR of the host galaxy. The apparent luminosity of the diffuse emission in the 0.5--2 keV band linearly correlates with the SFR with the scale factor of Lx/SFR≈8.3×1038ergs−1(M⊙yr−1)−1, of which in average ∼30--40 per cent is likely produced by faint compact sources of various types. We attempt to estimate the bolometric luminosity of the gas and obtain results differing by an order of magnitude, log(Lbol/SFR) ∼ 39−40, depending on whether intrinsic absorption in star-forming galaxies is allowed or not. Our theoretically most accurate, but in practice the most model-dependent result for the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the ISM is Lbol/SFR ∼ 1.5×1040erg s−1(M⊙yr−1)−1. Assuming that core-collapse supernovae are the main source of energy, it is implied that ϵSN ∼ 5×10−2(ESN/1051)−1 of mechanical energy of supernovae is converted into thermal energy of the ISM.}},

	abstract = {{We present a new model for computing consistently the line and continuum emission from galaxies, based on a combination of recent population synthesis and photoionization codes. We use effective parameters to describe the H ii regions and the diffuse gas ionized by single stellar generations in a galaxy, among which the most important ones are the zero-age effective ionization parameter, the effective gas metallicity and the effective dust-to-heavy element ratio. We calibrate the nebular properties of our model using the observed [O iii]/Hβ, [O ii]/[O iii], [S ii]/Hα and [N ii]/[S ii] ratios of a representative sample of nearby spiral and irregular, starburst and H ii galaxies. To compute whole (line plus continuum) spectral energy distributions, we include the absorption by dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) using a recent simple prescription, which is consistent with observations of nearby starburst galaxies. Our model enables us to interpret quantitatively the observed optical spectra of galaxies in terms of stars, gas and dust parameters. We find that the range of ionized-gas properties spanned by nearby galaxies implies factors of 3.5 and 14 variations in the Hα and [O ii] luminosities produced per unit star formation rate (SFR). When accounting for stellar Hα absorption and absorption by dust in the neutral ISM, the actual uncertainties in SFR estimates based on the emergent Hα and [O ii] luminosities are as high as several decades. We derive new estimators of the SFR, the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the effective absorption optical depth of the dust in galaxies. We show that, with the help of other lines such as [O ii], Hβ, [O iii], [N ii] or [S ii], the uncertainties in SFR estimates based on Hα can be reduced to a factor of only 2--3, even if the Hα line is blended with the adjacent [N ii] lines. Without Hα, however, the SFR is difficult to estimate from the [O ii], Hβ and [O iii] lines. The reason for this is that the absorption by dust in the neutral ISM and the ionized-gas parameters are then difficult to constrain independently. This suggests that, while insufficient by itself, the Hα line is essential for estimating the star formation rate from the optical emission of a galaxy.}},

	abstract = {We present a spectroscopic and photometric analysis of a sample of 416,288 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) matched to mid-infrared (mid-IR) data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). By using a new spectroscopic fitting package, GELATO (Galaxy/AGN Emission Line Analysis TOol), we are able to retrieve emission line fluxes and uncertainties for SDSS spectra and robustly determine the presence of broad lines and outflowing components, enabling us to investigate WISE color space as a function of optical spectroscopic properties. In addition, we pursue spectral energy distribution template fitting to assess the relative active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution and nuclear obscuration to compare to existing mid-IR selection criteria with WISE. We present a selection criterion in mid-IR color space to select AGNs with an ∼80% accuracy and a completeness of ∼16%. This is the first mid-IR color selection defined by solely using the distribution of Type I and Type II optical spectroscopic AGNs in WISE mid-IR color space. Our selection is an improvement of ∼50% in the completeness of targeting spectroscopic AGNs with WISE down to an SDSS r &lt; 17.77 mag. In addition, our new criterion targets a less-luminous population of AGNs, with on average lower [O iii] luminosities by ∼30% ( &gt; 0.1 dex) compared to typical WISE color--color selections. With upcoming large photometric surveys without corresponding spectroscopy, our method presents a way to select larger populations of AGNs at lower AGN luminosities and higher nuclear obscuration levels than traditional mid-IR color selections.},

	abstract = {Nearby, low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offer the best local analogs to study the early evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (BHs). Here we present a detailed multiwavelength investigation of star formation and BH activity in the low-metallicity dwarf--dwarf galaxy merger Mrk 709. Using Hubble Space Telescope Hα and continuum imaging combined with Keck spectroscopy, we determine that the two dwarf galaxies are likely in the early stages of a merger (i.e., their first pass) and discover a spectacular ∼10 kpc long string of young massive star clusters (t ≲ 10 Myr;  M ⋆ ≳ 105  M ⊙) between the galaxies triggered by the interaction. We find that the southern galaxy, Mrk 709 S, is undergoing a clumpy mode of star formation resembling that seen in high-redshift galaxies, with multiple young clusters/clumps having stellar masses between 107 and 108  M ⊙. Furthermore, we present additional evidence for a low-luminosity AGN in Mrk 709 S (first identified by Reines et al. using radio and X-ray observations), including the detection of the coronal [Fe x] optical emission line. The work presented here provides a unique glimpse into processes key to hierarchical galaxy formation and BH growth in the early universe.},

	abstract = {We present an entirely new sample of 388 low-mass galaxies (M ⋆ ≤ 1010 M ⊙) that have spectroscopic signatures indicating the presence of massive black holes (BHs) in the form of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or tidal disruption events. Of these, 70 have stellar masses in the dwarf galaxy regime with 108 ≲ M ⋆/M ⊙ ≲ 109.5. We identify the active galaxies by analyzing optical spectra of a parent sample of ∼23,000 low-mass emission-line galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey Data Release 4, and employing four different diagnostics based on narrow emission-line ratios and the detection of high-ionization coronal lines. We find that 47 of the 388 low-mass active galaxies exhibit broad Hα in their spectra, corresponding to virial BH masses in the range M BH ∼ 105.0--7.7 M ⊙ with a median BH mass of 〈M BH〉 ∼ 106.2 M ⊙. Our sample extends to higher redshifts (z ≤ 0.3; 〈z〉 = 0.13) than previous samples of AGNs in low-mass/dwarf galaxies based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, which can be attributed to the spectroscopic limit of GAMA being ∼2 mag deeper. Moreover, our multi-diagnostic approach has revealed low-mass active galaxies spanning a wide range of properties, from blue star-forming dwarfs to luminous ``miniquasars'' powered by low-mass BHs. As such, this work has implications for BH seeding and AGN feedback at low masses.},

	abstract = {{We study the optical variability of a sample of candidate low-mass (dwarf and Seyfert) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using Zwicky Transient Facility g-band light curves. Our sample is compiled from broad-line AGNs in dwarf galaxies reported in the literature with single-epoch virial black hole (BH) masses in the range MBH ∼ 104--108 M⊙. We measure the characteristic `damping' time-scale of the optical variability τDRW, beyond which the power spectral density flattens, of a final sample of 79 candidate low-mass AGNs with high-quality light curves. Our results provide further confirmation of the MBH--τDRW relation from previous work within 1σ agreement, adding 78 new low-mass AGNs to the relation. The agreement suggests that the virial BH mass estimates for these AGNs are generally reasonable. We expect that the optical light curve of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) to vary with a rest-frame damping time-scale of ∼tens of hours, which could enable detection and direct mass estimation of accreting IMBHs in wide-field time-domain imaging surveys with sufficient cadence like with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.}},

	abstract = {We analyze the X-ray properties of a sample of 23 high-probability active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates with ultraviolet variability identified in Wasleske et al. Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton Observatory, we that find 11/23 nuclei are X-ray detected. We use spectral energy distribution modeling to compute star formation rates and show that the X-ray luminosities are typically in excess of the X-ray emission expected from star formation by at least an order of magnitude. Interestingly, this sample shows a diversity of optical spectroscopic properties. We explore possible reasons for why some objects lack optical spectroscopic signatures of black hole activity while still being UV-variable and X-ray bright. We find that host galaxy stellar emission and obscuration from gas and dust are potential factors. We study where this sample falls on relationships such as α OX − L 2500 and L X − L IR and find that some of the sample falls outside the typical scatter for these relations, indicating that they differ from the standard quasar population. With the diversity of optical spectroscopic signatures and varying impacts of dust and stellar emissions on our sample, these results emphasize the strength of variability in selecting the most complete set of AGN, regardless of other host galaxy properties.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic column density (NH) distribution of quasars is poorly known. At the high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z &lt; 1, the X-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurements that extend to energies above 10 keV. Using the hard X-ray observatory NuSTAR, along with archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data, we study the broad-band X-ray spectra of nine optically selected (from the SDSS), candidate Compton-thick (NH &gt; 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) type 2 quasars (CTQSO2s); five new NuSTAR observations are reported herein, and four have been previously published. The candidate CTQSO2s lie at z &lt; 0.5, have observed [O iii] luminosities in the range , and show evidence for extreme, Compton-thick absorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. Among the nine candidate CTQSO2s, five are detected by NuSTAR in the high-energy (8--24 keV) band: two are weakly detected at the ≈3σ confidence level and three are strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (≳90 net source counts at 8--24 keV). For these NuSTAR-detected sources direct (i.e., X-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic active galactic nucleus properties are feasible, and we measure column densities ≈2.5--1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed) X-ray luminosities ≈10--70 times higher than pre-NuSTAR constraints from Chandra and XMM-Newton. Assuming the NuSTAR-detected type 2 quasars are representative of other Compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the NH distribution for optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by Chandra and XMM-Newton for 39 objects. With this approach, we predict a Compton-thick fraction of  %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible if indirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.},

We show that star-forming galaxies and galaxies dominated by an active galactic nucleus form clearly separated branches in the  versus  diagnostic diagram and derive an empirical classification scheme which separates the two classes. We also present an analysis of the physical properties of 189 star-forming galaxies with strong  emissions. These star-forming galaxies provide constraints on the hard ionizing continuum of massive stars. To make a quantitative comparison with observation, we use photoionization models and examine how different stellar population models affect the predicted  emission. We confirm previous findings that the models can predict  emission only for instantaneous bursts of 20 per cent solar metallicity or higher, and only for ages of ∼4--5 Myr, the period when the extreme-ultraviolet continuum is dominated by emission from Wolf--Rayet stars. We find, however, that 83 of the star-forming galaxies (40 per cent) in our sample do not have Wolf--Rayet features in their spectra despite showing strong nebular  emission. We discuss possible reasons for this and possible mechanisms for the  emission in these galaxies.}},

@article{filippenko1997,
	abstract = { ▪ Abstract The temporal evolution of the optical spectra of various types of supernovae (SNe) is illustrated, in part to aid observers classifying supernova candidates. Type II SNe are defined by the presence of hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient SNe (Type I), three subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si II (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si II nor He I (Ic). The late-time spectra of SNe Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although SNe Ia, which result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. SNe Ib/Ic probably result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically related to SNe II. Indeed, the progenitors of some SNe II seem to have only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric subclasses (linear and plateau) of SNe II, which may exhibit minor spectroscopic differences, there is a new subclass (SNe IIn) distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves. These objects probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact. },

	abstract = {We investigate why half of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in deep surveys lack signs of accretion in their optical spectra. The majority of these "optically dull" AGNs are no more than ~6 times fainter than their host galaxies in rest-frame R band; as such, AGN lines are unlikely to be overwhelmed by stellar continuum in at least half the sample. We find that optically dull AGNs have the mid-infrared emission and LX/LIR ratios characteristic of local Seyfert galaxies, suggesting that the cause of optical dullness is not missing UV-optical continua. We compare the morphologies of 22 optically dull and 9 optically active AGNs at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and find that optically dull AGNs show a wide range of axis ratio, but optically active AGNs have only very round axis ratios. We conclude that hard X-rays select AGNs in host galaxies with a wide range of inclination angle, but only those AGNs in the most face-on or spheroidal host galaxies show optical emission lines. Thus, extranuclear dust in the host galaxy plays an important role in hiding the emission lines of optically dull AGNs.},

	abstract = {Ionization sources other than H ii regions give rise to the right-hand branch in the standard ([N ii]) BPT diagram, populated by Seyfert 2s and LINERs. However, because the majority of Seyfert/LINER hosts are star-forming (SF), H ii regions contaminate the observed lines to some extent, making it unclear if the position along the branch is merely due to various degrees of mixing between pure Seyferts/LINERs and SF, or whether it reflects the intrinsic diversity of Seyfert/LINER ionizing sources. In this study, we empirically remove SF contributions in ∼100,000 Seyferts/LINERs from SDSS using the doppelganger method. We find that mixing is not the principal cause of the extended morphology of the observed branch. Rather, Seyferts/LINERs intrinsically have a wide range of line ratios. Variations in ionization parameter and metallicity can account for much of the diversity of Seyfert/LINER line ratios, but the hardness of the ionization field also varies significantly. Furthermore, our k-means classification on seven decontaminated emission lines reveals that LINERs are made up of two populations, which we call soft and hard LINERs. The Seyfert 2s differ from both types of LINERs primarily by higher ionization parameter, whereas the two LINER types mainly differ from each other (and from star-forming regions) in the hardness of the radiation field. We confirm that the [N ii] BPT diagram more efficiently identifies LINERs than [S ii] and [O i] diagnostics, because in the latter many LINERs, especially soft ones, occupy the same location as pure starformers, even after the SF has been removed from LINER emission.},

Our atlas spans a broad range of galaxy types, including ellipticals, spirals, merging galaxies, blue compact dwarfs, and luminous infrared galaxies. We have combined ground-based optical drift-scan spectrophotometry with infrared spectroscopy from Spitzer and Akari with gaps in spectral coverage being filled using Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties spectral energy distribution models. The spectroscopy and models were normalized, constrained, and verified with matched-aperture photometry measured from Swift, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Spitzer, and Wide-field Infrared Space Explorer images. The availability of 26 photometric bands allowed us to identify and mitigate systematic errors present in the data. Comparison of our spectral energy distributions with other template libraries and the observed colors of galaxies indicates that we have smaller systematic errors than existing atlases, while spanning a broader range of galaxy types. Relative to the prior literature, our atlas will provide improved K-corrections, photometric redshifts, and star-formation rate calibrations.},

	abstract = {In this study, we use the Swift/BAT AGN sample, which has received extensive multiwavelength follow-up analysis as a result of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, to develop a diagnostic for nuclear obscuration by examining the relationship between the line-of-sight column densities (N H), the 2--10 keV to 12 μm luminosity ratio, and WISE mid-infrared colors. We demonstrate that heavily obscured AGNs tend to exhibit both preferentially ``redder'' mid-infrared colors and lower values of L X,Obs./L 12 μm than less obscured AGNs, and we derive expressions relating N H to the L X,Obs./L 12 μm and L 22 μm/L 4.6 μm luminosity ratios, as well as develop diagnostic criteria using these ratios. Our diagnostic regions yield samples that are ≳80% complete and ≳60% pure for AGNs with log(N H/cm−2) ≥ 24, as well as ≳85% pure for AGNs with . We find that these diagnostics cannot be used to differentiate between optically star-forming galaxies and active galaxies. Further, mid-IR contributions from host galaxies that dominate the observed 12 μm emission can lead to larger apparent X-ray deficits and redder mid-IR colors than the AGNs would intrinsically exhibit, though this effect helps to better separate less and more obscured AGNs. Finally, we test our diagnostics on two catalogs of AGNs and infrared galaxies, including the XMM-Newton XXL-N field, and we identify several known Compton-thick AGNs, as well as a handful of candidate heavily obscured AGNs based upon our proposed obscuration diagnostics.},

	abstract = {{Using Spitzer--infrared spectrograph (IRS) spectroscopy, we investigate the ubiquity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a complete (≈94 per cent), volume-limited sample of the most bolometrically luminous galaxies [LIR,8−1000 μm≳ (0.3--20) × 1010 L⊙] to D \\&lt; 15 Mpc. Our analyses are based on the detection of the high-excitation emission line [Ne v]λ14.32 μm (97.1 eV) to unambiguously identify AGN activity. We find that 17 of the 64 infrared (IR) bright galaxies in our sample host AGN activity (≈27+8−6 per cent), ?50 per cent of which are not identified as AGN using optical spectroscopy. The large AGN fraction indicates a tighter connection between AGN activity and IR luminosity for galaxies in the local Universe than previously found, potentially indicating a close association between AGN activity and star formation. The optically unidentified AGN span a wide range of galaxy type (S0--Ir) and are typically starburst-dominated systems hosting modest-luminosity AGN activity (L[Ne V]≈ 1037--1039 erg s−1). The non-identification of optical AGN signatures in the majority of these galaxies appears to be due to extinction towards the AGN, rather than intrinsically low-luminosity AGN activity; however, we note that the AGN optical signatures are diluted in some galaxies due to strong star formation activity. Examination of optical images shows that the optically unidentified AGN with evidence for extinction are hosted in either highly inclined galaxies or galaxies with dust lanes, indicating that obscuration of the AGN is not necessarily due to an obscuring torus. We therefore conclude that optical spectroscopic surveys miss approximately half of the AGN population simply due to extinction through the host galaxy.}},

	abstract = {The fraction of active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity obscured by dust and re-emitted in the mid-IR is critical for understanding AGN evolution, unification, and parsec-scale AGN physics. For unobscured (Type 1) AGNs, where we have a direct view of the accretion disk, the dust covering factor can be measured by computing the ratio of re-processed mid-IR emission to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity. We use this technique to estimate the obscured AGN fraction as a function of luminosity and redshift for 513 Type 1 AGNs from the XMM-COSMOS survey. The re-processed and intrinsic luminosities are computed by fitting the 18 band COSMOS photometry with a custom spectral energy distribution fitting code, which jointly models emission from hot dust in the AGN torus, from the accretion disk, and from the host galaxy. We find a relatively shallow decrease of the luminosity ratio as a function of Lbol, which we interpret as a corresponding decrease in the obscured fraction. In the context of the receding torus model, where dust sublimation reduces the covering factor of more luminous AGNs, our measurements require a torus height that increases with luminosity as . Our obscured-fraction--luminosity relation agrees with determinations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey censuses of Type 1 and Type 2 quasars and favors a torus optically thin to mid-IR radiation. We find a much weaker dependence of the obscured fraction on 2--10 keV luminosity than previous determinations from X-ray surveys and argue that X-ray surveys miss a significant population of highly obscured Compton-thick AGNs. Our analysis shows no clear evidence for evolution of the obscured fraction with redshift.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour--magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.}},

	abstract = {We present the results of an archival study of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) Astro-2 database. Nineteen spectra of star-forming regions and starburst galaxies were retrieved, reprocessed, and analyzed. The spectra cover the wavelength region 912-1800 {\AA}, providing access to the domain of peak luminosity from a young stellar population. We created an atlas of galaxy spectra documenting the continuum and line properties with an emphasis on the relatively unexplored spectral region below 1200 {\AA}. The dust obscuration law was derived from a comparison of the HUT spectra with synthetic population models. The law is similar to the commonly adopted starburst reddening curve at longer wavelengths and approaches the Milky Way law near the Lyman break. A simple power-law parameterization is given, which allows users to express the reddening law in terms of the stellar or nebular color excess at ultraviolet or optical wavelengths. The star formation histories were derived from the reddening-corrected continua and the ultraviolet line profiles. We find typical ages of tens of Myr and star formation densities ranging from less than 0.1 to more than 10 M⊙ yr-1 kpc-2. The absorbed ultraviolet luminosity correlates very well with the far-infrared luminosity, as expected if the dominant dust absorption occurs in a foreground screen. This correlation holds even for the most luminous galaxies in our sample, whose IRAS luminosity is in excess of 1011 L⊙.},

	abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ ≳ 40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T ~ 40-55 K (warm dust) and T ~ 20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ϵ = 2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as "UV bright," for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z ≳ 1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

	abstract = {Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory imaging of M31 is used, with a physical dust model, to construct maps of dust surface density, dust-to-gas ratio, starlight heating intensity, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, out to R ≈ 25 kpc. The global dust mass is Md = 5.4 × 107 M☉, the global dust/H mass ratio is Md/MH = 0.0081, and the global PAH abundance is 〈qPAH〉 = 0.039. The dust surface density has an inner ring at R = 5.6 kpc, a maximum at R = 11.2 kpc, and an outer ring at R ≈ 15.1 kpc. The dust/gas ratio varies from Md/MH ≈ 0.026 at the center to ∼0.0027 at R ≈ 25 kpc. From the dust/gas ratio, we estimate the interstellar medium metallicity to vary by a factor ∼10, from Z/Z☉ ≈ 3 at R = 0 to ∼0.3 at R = 25 kpc. The dust heating rate parameter 〈U〉 peaks at the center, with 〈U〉 ≈ 35, declining to 〈U〉 ≈ 0.25 at R = 20 kpc. Within the central kiloparsec, the starlight heating intensity inferred from the dust modeling is close to what is estimated from the stars in the bulge. The PAH abundance reaches a peak qPAH ≈ 0.045 at R ≈ 11.2 kpc. When allowance is made for the different spectrum of the bulge stars, qPAH for the dust in the central kiloparsec is similar to the overall value of qPAH in the disk. The silicate--graphite--PAH dust model used here is generally able to reproduce the observed dust spectral energy distribution across M31, but overpredicts 500 μm emission at R ≈ 2--6 kpc, suggesting that at R = 2--6 kpc, the dust opacity varies more steeply with frequency (with β ≈ 2.3 between 200 and 600 μm) than in the model.},

@article{chabrier2003,
	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present‐day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy---disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters---and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power‐law form for m≳1 M⊙ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc ∼ 0.08 M⊙ and a variance in logarithmic mass σ ∼ 0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc ∼ 0.2 M⊙ and σ ∼ 0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L‐ and T‐dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD ∼ n* ∼ 0.1 pc−3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages ≳130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick‐disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc ∼ 0.2--0.3 M⊙, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ∼1 M⊙. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present‐day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present‐day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass‐to‐light ratio determinations. The mass‐to‐light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8--1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans‐type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super‐Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large‐scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.},

	abstract = {{The primary source of emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the accretion disc, is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty structure (`the so-called dusty torus'). The infrared radiation emitted by the dust is nothing but a reprocessed fraction of the accretion disc emission, so the ratio of the torus to the AGN luminosity (Ltorus/LAGN) should corresponds to the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, i.e. the covering factor. We undertook a critical investigation of the Ltorus/LAGN as the dust covering factor proxy. Using state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we calculated a grid of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) emitted by the clumpy two-phase dusty structure. With this grid of SEDs, we studied the relation between Ltorus/LAGN and the dust covering factor for different parameters of the torus. We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus anisotropy makes Ltorus/LAGN underestimate low covering factors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs Ltorus/LAGN always underestimates covering factors. Our results provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain correct covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we demonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN fraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the dust covering factors show very weak dependence on LAGN, with values in the range of ≈0.6--0.7. Our results also suggest a higher fraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray surveys, in part owing to the presence of a Compton-thick AGN population predicted by population synthesis models.}},

	abstract = {{We investigate the emission of active galactic nucleus (AGN) dusty tori in infrared domain. Following theoretical predictions derived from hydrodynamical simulations, we model the dusty torus as a 3D two-phase medium with high-density clumps and low-density medium filling the space between the clumps. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images of the torus at different wavelengths are obtained using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code skirt. Our approach of generating clumpy structure allows us to model the tori with single clumps, complex structures of merged clumps or interconnected sponge-like structure. A corresponding set of clumps-only models and models with smooth dust distribution is calculated for comparison. We found that dust distribution, optical depth, clump size and their actual arrangement in the innermost region all have an impact on the shape of near- and mid-infrared SED. The 10-μm silicate feature can be suppressed for some parameters, but models with smooth dust distribution are also able to produce a wide range of silicate feature strength. Finally, we find that having the dust distributed in a two-phase medium might offer a natural solution to the lack of emission in near-infrared, compared to observed data, which affects clumpy models currently available in the literature.}},

	abstract = {{Following the discovery of a new class of X-ray variability seen in four galaxies, dubbed quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), we reconsider the variability seen in the low-mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) 2XMM J123103.2+110648 to ascertain whether it should be considered a QPE host galaxy. We apply the autocorrelation function to two archival XMM--Newton observations to determine characteristic time-scales for variability of ∼13.52 and ∼14.35 ks. The modelling of light curves, both folded at these time-scales and unfolded, indicates that a Gaussian model is preferable over a sinusoidal model, with average durations for the bright phases of 6.17 and 7.69 ks. In a broad 0.2--1.0 keV band the average amplitude of the bright phases was found to be 2.86 and 8.56 times the quiescent count rate. The pattern of variability seen in 2XMM J123103.2+110648 cannot be definitively declared as a series of QPEs. Instead, this suggests there may be a continuum of quasi-periodic variability ranging from eruptions to oscillations being caused by a single mechanism. This offers the possibility of finding further sources that continue to bridge the gap between QPEs and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). A targeted analysis of 47 observations of 11 other low-mass AGN (log (MBH) ≲ 6) found no evidence of QPE- or QPO-like behaviour in a sample of other similar mass objects.}},

	abstract = {We present high-quality (high signal-to-noise ratio and moderate spectral resolution) near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopic observations of 23 well-known broad emission line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In addition, we obtained simultaneous (within 2 months) optical spectroscopy of similar quality. The near-IR broad emission line spectrum of AGNs is dominated by permitted transitions of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and calcium, and by the rich spectrum of singly ionized iron. In this paper we present the spectra, line identifications, and measurements, and we address briefly some of the important issues regarding the physics of AGN broad emission line regions. In particular, we investigate the excitation mechanism of neutral oxygen and confront for the first time theoretical predictions of the near-IR iron emission spectrum with observations.},

	abstract = {A primary aim of the  (NuSTAR) mission is to find and characterize heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Based on mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, we have selected a large population of luminous obscured AGNs (i.e., ``obscured quasars''). Here we report NuSTAR observations of four WISE-selected heavily obscured quasars for which we have optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatory. Optical diagnostics confirm that all four targets are AGNs. With NuSTAR hard X-ray observations, three of the four objects are undetected, while the fourth has a marginal detection. We confirm that these objects have observed hard X-ray (10--40 keV) luminosities at or below ∼1043 erg s−1. We compare X-ray and IR luminosities to obtain estimates of the hydrogen column densities (NH) based on the suppression of the hard X-ray emission. We estimate NH of these quasars to be at or larger than 1025 cm−2, confirming that WISE and optical selection can identify very heavily obscured quasars that may be missed in X-ray surveys, and they do not contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background. From the optical Balmer decrements, we found that our three extreme obscured targets lie in highly reddened host environments. This galactic extinction cannot adequately explain the more obscured AGNs, but it may imply a different scale of obscuration in the galaxy.},

@article{strubbe2009,
	abstract = {{A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH) is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ∼10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH∼ 105--106 M⊙ and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs.}},

@article{cao2018,
	abstract = {{In the canonical model for tidal disruption events (TDEs), the stellar debris circularizes quickly to form an accretion disc of size about twice the orbital pericentre of the star. Most TDEs and candidates discovered in the optical/ultraviolet have broad optical emission lines with complex and diverse profiles of puzzling origin. Liu et al. recently developed a relativistic elliptical disc model of constant eccentricity in radius for the broad optical emission lines of TDEs and well reproduced the double-peaked line profiles of the TDE candidate PTF09djl with a large and extremely eccentric accretion disc. In this paper, we show that the optical emission lines of the TDE ASASSN-14li with radically different profiles are well modelled with the relativistic elliptical disc model, too. The accretion disc of ASASSN-14li has an eccentricity 0.97 and semimajor axis of 847 times the Schwarzschild radius (rS) of the black hole (BH). It forms as the consequence of tidal disruption of a star passing by a massive BH with orbital pericentre 25rS. The optical emission lines of ASASSN-14li are powered by an extended X-ray source of flat radial distribution overlapping the bulk of the accretion disc and the single-peaked asymmetric line profiles are mainly due to the orbital motion of the emitting matter within the disc plane of inclination about 26$\,^{\circ}$ and of pericentre orientation closely toward the observer. Our results suggest that modelling the complex line profiles is powerful in probing the structures of accretion discs and coronal X-ray sources in TDEs.}},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies is expected to produce unique emission-line signatures, which have not yet been explored adequately. Here we report the discovery of extremely strong coronal lines from [Fe x] up to [Fe xiv] in a sample of seven galaxies (including two recently reported cases), which we interpret as such signatures. This is the first systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use of the immense database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxies, which are non-active as evidenced by the narrow line ratios, show broad emission lines of complex profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the high-ionization coronal lines and the broad lines are fading on timescales of years in objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolute magnitudes of at least −16 to −18 mag in the g band, are also detected in more than half of the sample. The coronal line emitters reside in sub-L* disk galaxies (−21.3 &lt; Mi &lt; −18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions. The sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence of the [Fe vii] lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [O iii], [Fe xi], and the host galaxies. These characteristics can most naturally be understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such events to be around 10−5 yr−1 for a galaxy with −21.3 &lt; Mi &lt; −18.5.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of superstrong, fading, high-ionization iron line emission in the galaxy SDSS J095209.56+214313.3 (SDSS J0952+2143 hereafter), which must have been caused by an X-ray outburst of large amplitude. SDSS J0952+2143 is unique in its strong multiwavelength variability; such a broadband emission-line and continuum response has not been observed before. The strong iron line emission is accompanied by unusual Balmer line emission with a broad base, narrow core, and double-peaked narrow horns, and strong He II emission. These lines, while strong in the SDSS spectrum taken in 2005, have faded away significantly in new spectra taken in 2007 December. Comparison of SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX, and follow-up GROND photometry reveals variability in the NUV, optical, and NIR band. Taken together, these unusual observations can be explained by a giant outburst in the EUV-X-ray band, detected even in the optical and NIR. The intense and variable iron, helium, and Balmer lines represent the ``light echo'' of the flare, as it traveled through circumnuclear material. The outburst may have been caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. Spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS are well suited to detect emission-line light echoes of such rare flare events. Reverberation-mapping of these light echoes can then be used as a new and efficient probe of the physical conditions in the circumnuclear material in nonactive or active galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present 0.5--8.0 keV Chandra observations of six bright quasars that represent extrema in quasar emission-line properties---three quasars each with small and large blueshifts of the C IV emission line with respect to the systemic redshift of the quasars. Supplemented with seven archival Chandra observations of quasars that met our selection criteria, we investigate the origin of this emission-line phenomenon in the general context of the structure of quasars. We find that the quasars with the largest C IV blueshifts show evidence, from joint spectral fitting, for intrinsic X-ray absorption (NH ∼ 1022 cm-2). Given the lack of accompanying C IV absorption, this gas is likely to be highly ionized and may be identified with the shielding gas in the disk-wind paradigm. Furthermore, we find evidence for a correlation of αUV, the ultraviolet spectral index, with the hardness of the X-ray continuum; an analysis of independent Bright Quasar Survey data from the literature supports this conclusion. This result points to intrinsically red quasars having systematically flatter hard X-ray continua without evidence for X-ray absorption. We speculate on the origins of these correlations of X-ray properties with both C IV blueshift and αUV and discuss the implications for models of quasar structure.},

	abstract = {We carry out classification of 4330 X-ray sources in the 2XMMi-DR3 catalog. They are selected under the requirement of being a point source with multiple XMM-Newton observations and at least one detection with the signal-to-noise ratio larger than 20. For about one-third of them we are able to obtain reliable source types from the literature. They mostly correspond to various types of stars (611), active galactic nuclei (AGNs, 753), and compact object systems (138) containing white dwarfs, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. We find that about 99% of stars can be separated from other source types based on their low X-ray-to-IR flux ratios and frequent X-ray flares. AGNs have remarkably similar X-ray spectra, with the power-law photon index centered around 1.91 $\pm$ 0.31, and their 0.2--4.5 keV flux long-term variation factors have a median of 1.48, with 98.5% being less than 10. In contrast, 70% of compact object systems can be very soft or hard, highly variable in X-rays, and/or have very large X-ray-to-IR flux ratios, separating them from AGNs. Using these results, we derive a source type classification scheme to classify the other sources and find 644 candidate stars, 1376 candidate AGNs, and 202 candidate compact object systems, whose false identification probabilities are estimated to be about 1%, 3%, and 18%, respectively. There are still 320 sources associated with nearby galaxies and 151 in the Galactic plane, which we expect to be mostly compact object systems or background AGNs. We also have 100 candidate ultraluminous X-ray sources. They are found to be much less variable than other accreting compact objects.},

We identified 48 high-probability candidate AGNs from a parent sample of 1819 galaxies in the NASA Sloan Atlas catalog. We further characterized these systems using optical spectroscopic diagnostics, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer IR color selection criteria, and spectral energy distribution modeling. Of the 48 candidates, eight were identified as AGNs from optical emission lines, two were identified by their IR colors, and 28 were identified through spectral energy decomposition. Observational biases of each selection method are discussed in connecting these AGN subsamples to another. By selecting AGNs based on UV variability, we also identified six low-mass AGN candidates, all of which would have been missed by spectroscopic selection.},

	abstract = {An overview of our current knowledge of black seed formation models following their growth history over cosmic time is presented. Both light seed formation channels remnants of the first stars and the more massive direct collapse seed formation scenarios are outlined. In particular, the focus is on the implications of these various scenarios and what these initial conditions imply for the highest redshift black holes, the local black hole population, the highest mass black holes at each epoch and the low mass end of the black hole mass function all of which are currently observed. The goal is to present a broad and comprehensive picture of the current status; the open questions and challenges faced by black hole growth models in matching current observational data and the prospects for future observations that will help discriminate between competing models.},

	abstract = {We present a sample of hard X-ray-selected candidate black holes (BHs) in 19 dwarf galaxies. BH candidates are identified by cross-matching a parent sample of ∼44,000 local dwarf galaxies ( , ) with the Chandra Source Catalog and subsequently analyzing the original X-ray data products for matched sources. Of the 19 dwarf galaxies in our sample, eight have X-ray detections reported here for the first time. We find a total of 43 point-like hard X-ray sources with individual luminosities erg s−1. Hard X-ray luminosities in this range can be attained by stellar-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) and by massive BHs accreting at low Eddington ratio. We place an upper limit of 53% (10/19) on the fraction of galaxies in our sample hosting a detectable hard X-ray source consistent with the optical nucleus, although the galaxy center is poorly defined in many of our objects. We also find that 42% (8/19) of the galaxies in our sample exhibit statistically significant enhanced hard X-ray emission relative to the expected galaxy-wide contribution from low-mass and high-mass XRBs, based on the star formation rate relation defined by more massive and luminous systems. For the majority of these X-ray-enhanced dwarf galaxies, the excess emission is consistent with (but not necessarily due to) a nuclear X-ray source. Follow-up observations are necessary to distinguish between stellar-mass XRBs and active galactic nuclei powered by more massive BHs. In any case, our results support the notion that X-ray-emitting BHs in low-mass dwarf galaxies may have had an appreciable impact on reionization in the early universe.},

	abstract = { Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by the accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and are among the most luminous objects in the Universe. However, the huge radiative power of most AGN cannot be seen directly, as the accretion is hidden behind gas and dust that absorb many of the characteristic observational signatures. This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology. We conclude with an outline of the prospects for future progress from both observations and theoretical models, and we highlight some of the key outstanding questions. },

@article{ricarte2018,
	abstract = {{The origin and properties of the initial black hole seeds that grow to produce the observed population of accreting sources remain to be determined. It is a challenge to uniquely disentangle signatures of seeding from fuelling and dynamics that shapes the assembly history of growing black holes. To address this, we use a semi-analytic model developed to track the growth of supermassive black holes adopting multiple prescriptions for accretion. In contrast with earlier treatments, we explore the interplay between seeding models and two accretion modes. We find that signatures of the initial seeding do survive in the following observational probes: the black hole occupation fraction; contribution to the unresolved X-ray background; low-luminosity and high-redshift luminosity functions; and gravitational wave event signatures. We find that the behaviour of the low-mass end of the M*--σ relation is dominated by uncertainties in the adopted accretion prescriptions and does not offer clear discrimination between seeding models. We make concrete predictions for future surveys, particularly for the Lynx X-ray surveyor and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, which will each provide different and yet strong constraints on the seed population. Black hole coalescences detected by LISA and high-redshift quasar luminosity functions observed by Lynx will offer the sharpest seeding discriminants. Although the signatures of the black hole seeding mechanism that persist remain linked to our understanding of black hole accretion and dynamics, we offer new insights on how these upcoming multiwavelength observations could be leveraged to effectively disentangle them.}},

	abstract = {Evidence shows that massive black holes reside in most local galaxies. Studies have also established a number of relations between the MBH mass and properties of the host galaxy such as bulge mass and velocity dispersion. These results suggest that central MBHs, while much less massive than the host (\~{}0.1{\%}), are linked to the evolution of galactic structure. In hierarchical cosmologies, a single big galaxy today can be traced back to the stage when it was split up in hundreds of smaller components. Did MBH seeds form with the same efficiency in small proto-galaxies, or did their formation had to await the buildup of substantial galaxies with deeper potential wells? I briefly review here some of the physical processes that are conducive to the evolution of the massive black hole population. I will discuss black hole formation processes for `seed'black holes that are likely to place at early cosmic epochs, and possible observational tests of these scenarios.},

	abstract = {We characterize the optical variability of quasars in the Palomar Transient Factory and intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (PTF/iPTF) surveys. We re-calibrate the r-band light curves for ∼28,000 luminous, broad-line active galactic nuclei from the SDSS, producing a total of ∼2.4 million photometric data points. We utilize both the structure function (SF) and power spectrum density (PSD) formalisms to search for links between the optical variability and the physical parameters of the accreting supermassive black holes that power the quasars. The excess variance (SF2) of the quasar sample tends to zero at very short time separations, validating our re-calibration of the time-series data. We find that the the amplitude of variability at a given time-interval, or equivalently the timescale of variability to reach a certain amplitude, is most strongly correlated with luminosity with weak or no dependence on black hole mass and redshift. For a variability level of SF(τ) = 0.07 mag, the timescale has a dependency of . This is broadly consistent with the expectation from a simple Keplerian accretion disk model, which provides . The PSD analysis also reveals that many quasar light curves are steeper than a damped random walk. We find a correlation between the steepness of the PSD slopes, specifically the fraction of slopes steeper than 2.5, and black hole mass, although we cannot exclude the possibility that luminosity or Eddington ratio are the drivers of this effect. This effect is also seen in the SF analysis of the (i)PTF data, and in a PSD analysis of quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82.},

@article{macleod2011,
	abstract = {We develop a method for separating quasars from other variable point sources using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 light-curve data for ∼ 10,000 variable objects. To statistically describe quasar variability, we use a damped random walk model parametrized by a damping timescale, τ, and an asymptotic amplitude (structure function), SF∞. With the aid of an SDSS spectroscopically confirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typical extragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples with reasonable purity (or efficiency, E). Compared to a selection method based solely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the τ information boosts E from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample (98%) even in the absence of color information. For a completeness of C = 90%, E is boosted from 80% to 85%. Conversely, C improves from 90% to 97% while maintaining E = 80% when imposing a lower limit on τ. With the aid of color selection, the purity can be further boosted to 96%, with C = 93%. Hence, selection methods based on variability will play an important role in the selection of quasars with data provided by upcoming large sky surveys, such as Pan-STARRS and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). For a typical (simulated) LSST cadence over 10 years and a photometric accuracy of 0.03 mag (achieved at i ≈ 22), C is expected to be 88% for a simple sample selection criterion of τ>100 days. In summary, given an adequate survey cadence, photometric variability provides an even better method than color selection for separating quasars from stars.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion sigma of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade.   New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M&sun; are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.   The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = { We describe ongoing searches for intermediate-mass black holes with MBH ≈ 10--105 M⊙. We review a range of search mechanisms, both dynamical and those that rely on accretion signatures. We find the following conclusions: ▪ Dynamical and accretion signatures alike point to a high fraction of 109--1010 M⊙ galaxies hosting black holes with MBH∼ 105 M⊙. In contrast, there are no solid detections of black holes in globular clusters. ▪ There are few observational constraints on black holes in any environment with MBH ≈ 100--104 M⊙. ▪ Considering low-mass galaxies with dynamical black hole masses and constraining limits, we find that the MBH--σ* relation continues unbroken to MBH ∼105 M⊙, albeit with large scatter. We believe the scatter is at least partially driven by a broad range in black hole masses, because the occupation fraction appears to be relatively high in these galaxies. ▪ We fold the observed scaling relations with our empirical limits on occupation fraction and the galaxy mass function to put observational bounds on the black hole mass function in galaxy nuclei. ▪ We are pessimistic that local demographic observations of galaxy nuclei alone could constrain seeding mechanisms, although either high-redshift luminosity functions or robust measurements of off-nuclear black holes could begin to discriminate models. },

	abstract = {We describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the GR2 and GR3 data releases of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). These releases have identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over the GR1 data release. GALEX continues to survey the sky in the far-ultraviolet (FUV, ~154 nm) and near-ultraviolet (NUV, ~232 nm) bands, providing simultaneous imaging with a pair of photon-counting, microchannel plate, delay line readout detectors. These 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ field of view detectors are well suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent red rejection and negligible background. A dithered mode of observing and photon list output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline, entangling detector calibrations, and aspect reconstruction algorithms. Recent improvements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mAB in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We have detected a long-term drift of order 1% FUV and 6% NUV over the mission. Astrometric precision is of order 0.5″ rms in both bands. In this paper we provide the GALEX user with a broad overview of the calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release. Improvements are likely as the GALEX mission continues into an extended phase with a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities for guest investigations.},

	abstract = {{We present an analysis of the host properties of 85 224 emission-line galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus--H ii (AGN--H ii) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [O iii] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [O iii] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[O iii]/σ4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixedL[O iii]/σ4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.}},

	abstract = {We present the selection and classification of over a thousand ultraviolet (UV) variable sources discovered in ∼40 deg2 of GALEX Time Domain Survey (TDS) NUV images observed with a cadence of 2 days and a baseline of observations of ∼3 years. The GALEX TDS fields were designed to be in spatial and temporal coordination with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey, which provides deep optical imaging and simultaneous optical transient detections via image differencing. We characterize the GALEX photometric errors empirically as a function of mean magnitude, and select sources that vary at the 5σ level in at least one epoch. We measure the statistical properties of the UV variability, including the structure function on timescales of days and years. We report classifications for the GALEX TDS sample using a combination of optical host colors and morphology, UV light curve characteristics, and matches to archival X-ray, and spectroscopy catalogs. We classify 62% of the sources as active galaxies (358 quasars and 305 active galactic nuclei), and 10% as variable stars (including 37 RR Lyrae, 53 M dwarf flare stars, and 2 cataclysmic variables). We detect a large-amplitude tail in the UV variability distribution for M-dwarf flare stars and RR Lyrae, reaching up to |Δm| = 4.6 mag and 2.9 mag, respectively. The mean amplitude of the structure function for quasars on year timescales is five times larger than observed at optical wavelengths. The remaining unclassified sources include UV-bright extragalactic transients, two of which have been spectroscopically confirmed to be a young core-collapse supernova and a flare from the tidal disruption of a star by dormant supermassive black hole. We calculate a surface density for variable sources in the UV with NUV < 23 mag and |Δm| > 0.2 mag of ∼8.0, 7.7, and 1.8 deg−2 for quasars, active galactic nuclei, and RR Lyrae stars, respectively. We also calculate a surface density rate in the UV for transient sources, using the effective survey time at the cadence appropriate to each class, of ∼15 and 52 deg−2 yr−1 for M dwarfs and extragalactic transients, respectively.},

	abstract = {{We review some practical aspects of measuring the amplitude of variability in `red noise' light curves typical of those from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in AGN light curves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, Fvar, and excess variance, σ2XS, are examined. Their statistical properties, relationship to the power spectrum and uses for investigating the nature of the variability processes are discussed. We demonstrate that σ2XS (or similarly Fvar) shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the variability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of these estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between different sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. Some examples of the expected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical power spectral shapes, based on Monte Carlo simulations. The excess variance can be useful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different energy bands from the same observation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to derive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected between different energy bands (due to measurement errors). Finally, these estimators are used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 766. The source is found to show a strong, linear correlation between rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.}},

	abstract = { ▪ Abstract A large collective effort to study the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over the past decade has led to a number of fundamental results on radio-quiet AGN and blazars. In radio-quiet AGN, the ultraviolet (UV) bump in low-luminosity objects is thermal emission from a dense medium, very probably an accretion disk, irradiated by the variable X-ray source. The validity of this model for high-luminosity radio-quiet AGN is unclear because the relevant UV and X-ray observations are lacking. The broad-line gas kinematics appears to be dominated by virialized motions in the gravity field of a black hole, whose mass can be derived from the observed motions. The ``accretion disk plus wind'' model explains most of the variability (and other) data and appears to be the most appropriate model at present. Future investigations are outlined. In blazars, rapid variability at the highest energies (gamma-rays) implies that the whole continuum is relativistically boosted along the line of sight. The general correlation found between variations in TeV gamma rays and in X rays for Mrk 421, and between variations in GeV gamma rays and in the IR--optical--UV bands for 3C 279, two prototype objects, supports models in which the same population of relativistic electrons radiates the low-frequency continuum via synchrotron and the high frequency continuum via inverse Compton scattering of soft photons. Identifying the dominant source of soft photons, which is at present unclear, will strongly constrain the jet physics. },

By matching GALEX and PS1 epochs in five bands (NUV, gP1, rP1, iP1, zP1) in time, and taking their flux difference, we create co-temporal difference-flux spectral energy distributions () using two chosen epochs for each of the 23 objects in our sample, on timescales of about a year. We confirm the ``bluer-when-brighter'' trend reported in previous studies, and measure a median spectral index of the of  = 2.1 that is consistent with an accretion disk spectrum. We further fit the of each source with a standard accretion disk model in which the accretion rate changes from one epoch to the other. In our sample, 17 out of 23 (∼74\%) sources are described well by this variable accretion-rate disk model, with a median average characteristic disk temperature of K that is consistent with the temperatures expected, given the distribution of accretion rates and black hole masses inferred for the sample. Our analysis also shows that the variable accretion rate model is a better fit to the than a simple power law.},

	abstract = {An 8 month monitoring campaign on the Seyfert 1 galaxy Fairall 9 has been conducted with the International Ultraviolet Explorer in an attempt to obtain reliable estimates of continuum-continuum and continuum-emission-line delays for a high-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). While the results of this campaign are more ambiguous than those of previous monitoring campaigns on lower luminosity sources, we find general agreement with the earlier results: (1) there is no measurable lag between ultraviolet continuum bands, and (2) the measured emission-line time lags are very short. It is especially notable that the Lyα + N V emission-line lag is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than determined from a previous campaign by Clavel, Wamsteker, & Glass (1989) when Fairall 9 was in a more luminous state. In other well-monitored sources, specifically NGC 5548 and NGC 3783, the highest ionization lines are found to respond to continuum variations more rapidly than the lower ionization lines, which suggests a radially ionization-stratified broad-line region. In this case, the results are less certain, since none of the emission-line lags are very well determined. The best-determined emission line lag is Lyα + N V, for which we find that the centroid of the continuum-emission-line cross-correlation function is τcent ≈ 14-20 days. We measure a lag τcent ≲ 4 days for He II λ1640; this result is consistent with the ionization-stratification pattern seen in lower luminosity sources, but the relatively large uncertainties in the emission-line lags measured here cannot rule out similar lags for Lyα + N V and He II λ1640 at a high level of significance. We are unable to determine a reliable lag for C IV λ1550, but we note that the profiles of the variable parts of Lyα and C IV λ1550 are not the same, which does not support the hypothesis that the strongest variations in these two lines arise in the same region.},

	abstract = {We present an initial sample of 19 intermediate-mass black hole candidates in active galactic nuclei culled from the first data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using the line width-luminosity mass scaling relation established for broad-line active nuclei, we estimate black hole masses in the range of MBH ≈ 8 × M☉, a regime in which only two objects are currently known. The absolute magnitudes are faint for active galactic nuclei, ranging from Mg ≈ -15 to -18 mag, while the bolometric luminosities are all close to the Eddington limit. The entire sample formally satisfies the line width criterion for so-called narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; however, they display a wider range of Fe II and [O III] λ5007 line strengths than is typically observed in this class of objects. Although the available imaging data are of insufficient quality to ascertain the detailed morphologies of the host galaxies, it is likely that the majority of the hosts are relatively late-type systems. The host galaxies have estimated g-band luminosities ~1 mag fainter than M* for the general galaxy population at z ≈ 0.1. Beyond simply extending the known mass range of central black holes in galactic nuclei, these objects provide unique observational constraints on the progenitors of supermassive black holes. They are also expected to contribute significantly to the integrated signal for future gravitational wave experiments.},

	abstract = {We have completed an optical spectroscopic survey of the nuclear regions (r ≲ 200 pc) of a large sample of nearby galaxies. Although the main objectives of the survey are to search for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and to quantify their luminosity function, the database can be used for a variety of other purposes. This paper presents measurements of the spectroscopic parameters for the 418 emission-line nuclei, along with a compilation of the global properties of all 486 galaxies in the survey. Stellar absorption generally poses a serious obstacle to obtaining accurate measurement of emission lines in nearby galactic nuclei. We describe a procedure for removing the starlight from the observed spectra in an efficient and objective manner. The main parameters of the emission lines (intensity ratios, fluxes, profile widths, and equivalent widths) are measured and tabulated, as are several stellar absorption-line and continuum indices useful for studying the stellar population. Using standard nebular diagnostics, we determine the probable ionization mechanisms of the emission-line objects. The resulting spectral classifications provide extensive information on the demographics of emission-line nuclei in the nearby regions of the universe. This new catalog contains over 200 objects showing spectroscopic evidence for recent star formation and an equally large number of active galactic nuclei, including 46 that show broad Hα emission. These samples will serve as the basis of future studies of nuclear activity in nearby galaxies.},

	abstract = {{We report on continued, ∼15-yr long, broad Balmer emission lines in three metal-poor dwarf emission-line galaxies selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy. The persistent luminosity of the broad Balmer emission indicates the galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with virial black hole masses of ∼106.7--107.0 M⊙. The lack of observed hard X-ray emission and the possibility that the Balmer emission could be due to a long-lived stellar transient motivated additional follow-up spectroscopy. We also identify a previously unreported blueshifted narrow absorption line in the broad H α feature in one of the AGNs, indicating an AGN-driven outflow with hydrogen column densities of order 1017 cm−2. We also extract light curves from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility. We detect probable AGN-like variability in three galaxies, further supporting the AGN scenario. This also suggests the AGNs are not strongly obscured. This sample of galaxies are among the most metal-poor that host an AGN (Z = 0.05--0.16 Z⊙). We speculate they may be analogues to seed black holes which formed in unevolved galaxies at high redshift. Given the rarity of metal-poor AGNs and small sample size available, we investigate prospects for their identification in future spectroscopic and photometric surveys.}},

For 889,235 undetected stars, we develop a method to estimate their upper limit magnitudes. The distribution of (FUV − NUV) shows that the color declines with increasing effective temperature for stars hotter than 7000 K in our sample, while the trend disappears for the cooler stars due to upper atmosphere emission from the regions higher than their photospheres. For stars with valid stellar parameters, we calculate the UV excesses with synthetic model spectra, and find that the (FUV − NUV) versus can be fitted with a linear relation and late-type dwarfs tend to have high UV excesses. There are 87,178 and 1,498,103 stars detected more than once in the visit exposures of GALEX in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We make use of the quantified photometric errors to determine statistical properties of the UV variation, including intrinsic variability and the structure function on the timescale of days. The overall occurrence of possible false positives is below 1.3% in our sample. UV absolute magnitudes are calculated for stars with valid parallaxes, which could serve as a possible reference frame in the NUV. We conclude that the colors related to UV provide good criteria to distinguish between M giants and M dwarfs, and the variability of RR Lyrae stars in our sample is stronger than that of other A and F stars.},

	abstract = {{As part of our ongoing archival X-ray survey of galaxy clusters for tidal flares, we present evidence of an X-ray transient source within 1 arcmin of the core of Abell 1795. The extreme variability (a factor of nearly 50), luminosity (\\&gt;2 × 1042 erg s−1), long duration (\\&gt;5 yr) and supersoft X-ray spectrum (\\&lt;0.1 keV) are characteristic signatures of a stellar tidal disruption event according to theoretical predictions and to existing X-ray observations, implying a massive ≳105 M{\.o} black hole at the centre of that galaxy. The large number of X-ray source counts (∼700) and long temporal baseline (∼12 yr with Chandra and XMM--Newton) make this one of the best sampled examples of any tidal flare candidate to date. The transient may be the same EUV source originally found contaminating the diffuse intracluster medium observations of Bowyer, Bergh{\"o}fer and Korpela, which would make it the only tidal flare candidate with reported EUV observations and implies an early source luminosity 1--2 orders of magnitude greater. If the host galaxy is a cluster member then it must be a dwarf galaxy, an order of magnitude less massive than the quiescent galaxy Henize 2--10 which hosts a massive black hole that is difficult to reconcile with its low mass. The unusual faintness of the host galaxy may be explained by tidal stripping in the cluster core.}},

	abstract = {Using a sample of over 25,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show how quasar variability in the rest-frame optical/UV regime depends on rest-frame time lag, luminosity, rest wavelength, redshift, the presence of radio and X-ray emission, and the presence of broad absorption line systems. Imaging photometry is compared with three-band spectrophotometry obtained at later epochs spanning time lags up to about 2 yr. The large sample size and wide range of parameter values allow the dependence of variability to be isolated as a function of many independent parameters. The time dependence of variability (the structure function) is well fitted by a single power law with an index γ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.008, on timescales from days to years. There is an anticorrelation of variability amplitude with rest wavelength---e.g., quasars are about twice as variable at 1000 {\AA} as at 6000 {\AA}---and quasars are systematically bluer when brighter at all redshifts. There is a strong anticorrelation of variability with quasar luminosity---variability amplitude decreases by a factor of about 4 when luminosity increases by a factor of 100. There is also a significant positive correlation of variability amplitude with redshift, indicating evolution of the quasar population or the variability mechanism. We parameterize all of these relationships. Quasars with ROSAT All-Sky Survey X-ray detections are significantly more variable (at optical/UV wavelengths) than those without, and radio-loud quasars are marginally more variable than their radio-quiet counterparts. We find no significant difference in the variability of quasars with and without broad absorption line troughs. Currently, no models of quasar variability address more than a few of these relationships. Models involving multiple discrete events or gravitational microlensing are unlikely by themselves to account for the data. So-called accretion disk instability models are promising, but more quantitative predictions are needed.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a systematic search of low-mass black holes (BHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad Hα emission lines, aiming at building a homogeneous sample that is more complete than previous ones for fainter, less highly accreting sources. For this purpose, we developed a set of elaborate, automated selection procedures and applied it uniformly to the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Special attention is given to AGN--galaxy spectral decomposition and emission-line deblending. We define a sample of 309 type 1 AGNs with BH masses in the range 8 × 104--2 × 106 M☉ (with a median of 1.2 × 106 M☉), using the virial mass estimator based on the broad Hα line. About half of our sample of low-mass BHs differs from that of Greene & Ho, with 61 of them discovered here for the first time. Our new sample picks up more AGNs with low accretion rates: the Eddington ratios of the present sample range from ≲ 0.01 to ∼1, with 30% below 0.1. This suggests that a significant fraction of low-mass BHs in the local universe are accreting at low rates. The host galaxies of the low-mass BHs have luminosities similar to those of L* field galaxies, optical colors of Sbc spirals, and stellar spectral features consistent with a continuous star formation history with a mean stellar age of less than 1 Gyr.},

	abstract = {Searching for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is important for our understanding of the seed black holes that formed in the early universe. Here, we test infrared selection methods for AGN activity at low galaxy masses. Our parent sample consists of ∼18,000 nearby dwarf galaxies (M* < 3 × 109 M☉, z < 0.055) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with significant detections in the first three bands of the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). First, we demonstrate that the majority of optically selected AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not selected as AGNs using WISE infrared color diagnostics and that the infrared emission is dominated by the host galaxies. We then investigate the infrared properties of optically selected star-forming dwarf galaxies, finding that the galaxies with the reddest infrared colors are the most compact, with blue optical colors, young stellar ages, and large specific star formation rates. These results indicate that great care must be taken when selecting AGNs in dwarf galaxies using infrared colors, as star-forming dwarf galaxies are capable of heating dust in such a way that mimics the infrared colors of more luminous AGNs. In particular, a simple color cut alone should not be used to select AGNs in dwarf galaxies. With these complications in mind, we present a sample of 41 dwarf galaxies that fall in the WISE infrared color space typically occupied by more luminous AGNs and that are worthy of follow-up observations.},

	abstract = {We have carried out a survey of the north and south ecliptic poles, EP-N and EP-S, respectively, with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The primary objective was to cross-calibrate WISE with the Spitzer and Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) photometric systems by developing a set of calibration stars that are common to these infrared missions. The ecliptic poles were continuous viewing zones for WISE due to its polar-crossing orbit, making these areas ideal for both absolute and internal calibrations. The Spitzer IRAC and MIPS imaging survey covers a complete area of 0.40 deg2 for the EP-N and 1.28 deg2 for the EP-S. WISE observed the whole sky in four mid-infrared bands, 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm, during its eight-month cryogenic mission, including several hundred ecliptic polar passages; here we report on the highest coverage depths achieved by WISE, an area of ∼1.5 deg2 for both poles. Located close to the center of the EP-N, the Sy-2 galaxy NGC 6552 conveniently functions as a standard calibrator to measure the red response of the 22 μm channel of WISE. Observations from Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS/IRS-LL and WISE show that the galaxy has a strong red color in the mid-infrared due to star-formation and the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), while over a baseline >1 year the mid-IR photometry of NGC 6552 is shown to vary at a level less than 2%. Combining NGC 6552 with the standard calibrator stars, the achieved photometric accuracy of the WISE calibration, relative to the Spitzer and MSX systems, is 2.4%, 2.8%, 4.5%, and 5.7% for W1 (3.4 μm), W2 (4.6 μm), W3 (12 μm), and W4 (22 μm), respectively. The WISE photometry is internally stable to better than 0.1% over the cryogenic lifetime of the mission. The secondary objective of the Spitzer--WISE Survey was to explore the poles at greater flux-level depths, exploiting the higher angular resolution Spitzer observations and the exceptionally deep (in total coverage) WISE observations that potentially reach down to the confusion limit of the survey. The rich Spitzer and WISE data sets were used to study the Galactic and extragalactic populations through source counts, color--magnitude and color--color diagrams. As an example of what the data sets facilitate, we have separated stars from galaxies, delineated normal galaxies from power-law-dominated AGNs, and reported on the different fractions of extragalactic populations. In the EP-N, we find an AGN source density of ∼260 deg−2 to a 12 μm depth of 115 μJy, representing 15% of the total extragalactic population to this depth, similar to what has been observed for low-luminosity AGNs in other fields.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [O iii]λ5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[O iii]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hδ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [O iii] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [O iii] luminosities.}},

In this Letter, we have modeled for the first time the dependence of the optical narrow emission line strengths on the black hole mass of accreting AGN over the range of . We show that as the black hole mass decreases, the hardening of the spectral energy distribution from the accretion disk changes the ionization structure of the nebula. The enhanced high-energy emission from IMBHs results in a more extended partially ionized zone compared with models for higher mass black holes. This effect produces a net decrease in the predicted [O iii]/Hβ and [N ii]/Hα emission line ratios. Based on this model, we demonstrate that the standard optical narrow emission line diagnostics used to identify massive black holes fail when the black hole mass falls below for highly accreting IMBHs and for radiatively inefficient IMBHs with active star formation. Our models call into question the ability of common optical spectroscopic diagnostics to confirm AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies, and indicate that the low-mass black hole occupation fraction inferred from such diagnostics will be severely biased.},

	abstract = {{Although the supermassive (AGN) and stellar mass (BHBs) black holes have many properties in common, the broad emission lines (BELs) are exclusively signatures of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on the detection of these lines from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data bases, there seems to be no AGN with mass MBH ≲ 105 M⊙. In this paper, we investigate if such low-mass black holes are really non-existent or they are undetected because the BELs in them are not produced efficiently. Using the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a wide range of black hole mass, 10--109 M⊙, spanning black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) to AGN, we calculate the equivalent widths (EWs) of ultraviolet and optical lines Lyα  1216 {\AA}, Hβ  4861 {\AA}, C iv 1549 {\AA} and Mg ii 2798 {\AA}. The LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model has been used to describe the broad emission-line region (BELR) for the calculations. We find that the hardening of the SED shape with decreasing mass do not decrease the BEL EWs. However, finite size of the BELR, as measured by the line widths, which is controlled by the mass of the black hole, regulates the production of these emission lines. There seems to be a peak in the EWs of the emission lines for typical AGN black holes of ∼108 M⊙, below which the lines become intrinsically fainter with a sharp fall-off below ∼106 M⊙. This may be the cause of the absence of low-mass AGN in SDSS.}},

	abstract = {We present a large sample of infrared-luminous candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that lack X-ray detections in Chandra, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR fields. We selected all optically detected SDSS sources with redshift measurements, combined additional broadband photometry from WISE, UKIDSS, 2MASS, and GALEX, and modeled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our sample sources. We parameterize nuclear obscuration in our SEDs with and uncover thousands of powerful obscured AGNs that lack X-ray counterparts, many of which are identified as AGN candidates based on straightforward WISE photometric criteria. Using the observed luminosity correlation between rest-frame 2--10 keV () and rest-frame AGN (), we estimate the intrinsic X-ray luminosities of our sample sources and combine these data with flux limits from X-ray catalogs to determine lower limits on nuclear obscuration. Using the ratio of intrinsic-to-observed X-ray luminosity (), we find a significant fraction of sources with column densities approaching  cm--2, suggesting that multiwavelength observations are necessary to account for the population of heavily obscured AGNs. We simulate the underlying distribution for the X-ray non-detected sources in our sample through survival analysis, and confirm the presence of AGN activity via X-ray stacking. Our results point to a considerable population of extremely obscured AGNs undetected by current X-ray observatories.},

@article{mendez2013,
	abstract = {We present a study of Spitzer/IRAC and X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) selection techniques in order to quantify the overlap, uniqueness, contamination, and completeness of each. We investigate how the overlap and possible contamination of the samples depend on the depth of both the IR and X-ray data. We use Spitzer/IRAC imaging, Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging, and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey to construct galaxy and AGN samples at 0.2 < z < 1.2 over 8 deg2. We construct samples over a wide range of IRAC flux limits (SWIRE to GOODS depth) and X-ray flux limits (10 ks to 2 Ms). We compare IR-AGN samples defined using both the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and Donley et al. with X-ray-detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and X-ray surveys, we find that ∼75% of IR-selected AGNs are also identified as X-ray AGNs. This fraction increases to ∼90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data, indicating that at most ∼10% of IR-selected AGNs may be heavily obscured. The IR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by star-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though the selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall, the IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGNs, while the X-ray AGN samples identify a wider range of AGN accretion rates including low specific accretion rate AGNs, where the host galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of the IR and X-ray AGN samples have similar rest-frame colors and stellar masses; both selections identify AGNs in blue, star-forming and red, quiescent galaxies.},
